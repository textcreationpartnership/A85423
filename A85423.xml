         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119940:4"/> of Iſrael when <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> beſtirred them in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious reformation? And how was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> and <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Kingdome ſhaken when they did not regard Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but corrupted the worſhip of God, leaving the things of God to lie naked and open to enemies and evils. <hi>The Gold, blue ſilk, and purple</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſo ſafe, or ſhined ſo well within the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> had not the outſide been covered <hi>with red skins and Goats hair.</hi> Such a ſhelter ought Magiſtracy to be to Gods Church and all the things of Religion therein, whereby they may the better, and the brighter ſhine. And as the care and courage of Magiſtrates ought to be moſt in the matters of God: So among them their zeal ought to be moſt earneſt in the matter of the Sabbath. The Sabbath obſerved, is the <hi>Compendium</hi> and <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole practice of Piety. As the tranſgreſsion of the Sabbath is the violation of the whole Law of God. When the people of Iſrael went to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:119940:4"/> Manna on the day of the Sabbath, God makes his complaint to <hi>Moſes</hi> their Magiſtrate, ſaying, <hi>Exod. 16.18. How long will they refuſe to keep my Commandements, and to obey my Lawes? Lawes</hi> and <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> in the plural: In that they broke the <hi>Command of the Sabbath</hi> God accounts it as a breach of all his Commandements, and a ſin againſt all his concernments: This <hi>Moſes</hi> is to be affected with. And therefore all that are in office under God, ought to be moſt burning in zeal againſt Sabbath-ſins &amp; ſinners, and for due obſerving the day of the Sabbath. Such was the zeal of the firſt and beſt reformers, as we find in Scripture,<note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Socrat. <hi>lib.</hi> 5.

                  <l>How hereto you are bound, and</l>
                  <l>How herein you are backed.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You are bound that about theſe things above all you burn in zeal. Hath not God bound you? And have not you bound your ſelves? God hath bound you not onely as men, but as Magiſtrates by his holy commands to mind the matters of Religion before all other things in the world, <hi>Deut. 16.17, 18.</hi> We ſee what Injunctions are ſet upon the <hi>Supreame Magiſtrate</hi> in this regard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Magiſtrates ſubordinate are chiefly to ſee to ſuch things, above all to look that the dayes and duties of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be carefully kept up, by all <hi>within the Gates,</hi> as of their <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> ſo of their <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction, <hi>Exod. 20.10.</hi> Yea, you kave bound your ſelves by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oathes. Though civil things are principally expreſſed, yet all is in order
<pb facs="tcp:119940:6"/> to a higher end and greater good. True, ſome Magiſtrates, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> have made the matters of God ſubordinate to their own intereſts and the outward peace of their kingdoms, but it hath ever proved the fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of ſuch miſplacing Governours. State-ends muſt all be ſubordinate, the chief and uppermoſt end of all in power is to preſerve <hi>the things of God.</hi> The main end therefore of all your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is to maintain Gods worſhip, his holy Sabbaths, and whatever ſerves for his honour. As an oath hath a Divine Ground, ſo it is for ends Divine. And though many ſimple men that be brought before you diſcern God no more in oaths, then Chriſt in Sacraments, and therefore can take, yea, and break oaths (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> his Withs) at their wills; Yet what a ſolemn and ſacred thing an oath is you well know. Hereby you are bound, as to do juſt things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man, ſo to do things juſt for God much more. And as you are bound, ſo you are backed, and backed
<pb facs="tcp:119940:6"/> ſo, as may well work up your warmeſt courage in the cauſe of God, for the WAYES and DAYES of God. You are backed with good <hi>Lawes</hi> againſt all open offenders, and ſeen-Sabbath-ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Evil doers upon the Lords day. You are backed with the prayers of all Gods precious people, who pour out their hearts to God to preſerve, bleſſe, and proſper all pious Magiſtrates by whoſe means Godlineſſe may be promoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, <hi>1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</hi> You are backed with the promiſes of God, the preſence of God; God is with you, be valiant: Be valiant, for God is with you. <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour,</hi> ſayes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. <hi>6.12. Be ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> ayes God to Joſhua, <hi>I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thou ſtrong and very couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Chap. <hi>1.</hi> verſ. <hi>5, 6, 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, worthy <hi>SIRS,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you againſt all encounters cloath your ſelves with courage. You are to
<pb facs="tcp:119940:7"/> encourage others, (inferiour Officers are by your language, carriage, countenance, counſel, commands, to become couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) and therefore be you your ſelves full of fiery courage. The Audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men to ſin, even Sabbath-ſins; And the dulneſſe of men even to Gods Sabbath-ſervice, calls loud for courage in Chriſtian Magiſtrates. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had his ſcourge or whip, with which he drove men out of the Temple with their ſheep and oxen from their buying and ſelling: Magiſtrates had need have their whips, <hi>penal Lawes in force</hi> to drive men into publick places of Gods pure worſhip with their children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to hearing Gods holy Word and other duties upon the Lords day. Good SIRS, ſo far as you can put on with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled courage. Such muſt not be ſoft wood, but heart of Oak, that are in the place of <hi>civil pillars;</hi> not men of eaſie, facil, flexible, timorous natures; but men of unbended, unbiaſſed diſpoſitions, reſolutions, full of fortitude, valour, magnanimity, and of Maſculine ſpirits,

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Quickening and a wakening <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that appeared in the place of my abode about a year ago, put me then on publikely to preach and preſſe the practical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Chriſtian-Sabbath.</hi> And though upon that ſad providential paſſage, I thought it ſeaſonable to ſay ſomething upon that ſubject, yet at firſt I onely intended two Sermons as one dayes exerciſe, but I found <hi>the Bread</hi> ſo abundantly to multiply even in the breaking, that I could not but acknowlege the bounty of
<pb facs="tcp:119940:9"/> a Divine hand. Whereupon I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and upon the ſame further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. That ſoul-proviſion which was therein made, though ſome hungrily received, yet others hungrily refuſed, ſo that I could not but clearly ſee

                  <l>As God with,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which made me more to mind the matter. Hereupon having for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dayes diſcourſed, I was ſoon after much moved to tranſcribe ſome Notes thereof by me that were very unlegible in their firſt Draught. Theſe after coming into the hands of ſeveral friends, they much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me further to communicate the ſame. I conſidering they were both Gracious, and Judicious, thought it might be the Lords voice, and that whereunto I ought to liſten.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe conſidering of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf, I could not but confeſſe it might be of neceſſary uſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Sabbath. For
<pb facs="tcp:119940:9"/> whereas there are two ſorts [Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ward] whoſe caſe is ſinful and ſad: So here are two parts apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper remedies for their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and cure. He is not onely a ſtranger, but a ſtone in our Engliſh Iſrael, who doth not ſenſibly diſcern, concerning Gods ſacred Sabbath. As ſome putting off the practice of all good thereon: ſo others not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing any ſpirit of life therein. As ſome ſlighters of the Sabbath-day-duties: ſo others ſlighty in the duties of the Sabbath day. As ſome living in a fearful neglect: ſo others reſting in a formal diſcharge of a few feeble and faint performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The former part is pertinent to put men on to the practice of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſervice. The latter part is pertinent to pull men up, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Sabbath that they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. And indeed as the leavers of the Lords-day-duties: ſo the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſe in the duties of the Lords day,
<pb facs="tcp:119940:10"/> who would not condole their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and endeavour to quicken their affections? Theſe latter we as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould much lament, and if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible amend. The wonted way and day of Gods worſhip how doth it wax old in our Land? Like <hi>David, when he was old and ſtricken in years they covered him with cloathes, but he gat no heat; wherefore his ſervants ſaid to him, Let there be ſought for my Lord the King a young Virgin, and let her ſtand before the King, and let her cheriſh him, and let her lie in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that my Lord the King may get heat,</hi> 1 Kings 1.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>'Tis not ordinary cloaths or bare outward Ordinances that will bring warmth into this bleſſed day, that now ſeems with us to wax old and cold. We muſt ſeek for the Spirit of God, the ſpirit of duty, which as the ſoul being brought into its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome will put new life, with warmth thereinto. And were but the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:119940:10"/> day thus recovered to its heat and health, other duties of Religion would not long lie ſick: yea, though all religious duties with divers lie dead in our dayes, yet if this live, they would live likewiſe. Of the lively Lords day, we may ſay as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Eve,</hi> Gen. 3.20. <hi>She was the Mother of all living.</hi> As the Lord of the Sabbath is the Father: ſo the Sabbath of the Lord is the Mother of all ſpiritual life. In the womb of a wel-ſpent Sabbath are the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and beſt ſpiritual conceptions. In the armes and by the breaſts of ſuch bleſſed Sabbaths are born and brought up many new-born babes for God: yea, let the Spirit of the Lord ſpring life in the Lords-day-duties and Miniſterial endeavours, how ſoon would ſunk Chriſtians, decaying and dying profeſſors be fetched back that are going apace to the grave of Apoſtaſie, And other raiſed that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:119940:11"/> ſome have ſunk ſo low, and (God-ward) been dead ſo long, that we may ſay of them, as <hi>Martha</hi> of her brother, <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh,</hi> Joh. 11. yet we might look to ſee even ſuch <hi>Lazaruſſes</hi> ariſe from their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of ſin upon the ſpiritual living of Sabbaths and the ſacred ſervice of God; ſuch things I alſo conſidering, my encouragments have encreaſed thus publickly to appear in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe. Yet (as great cauſe requireth) reflecting upon my many infirmities, croſſe thoughts have ſometimes beſet me, not knowing what to do, but looking up to the Lord, at length I reſolved to let it go, conſidering likewiſe that the Lord oftentimes does great matters by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and unlikely means. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was pulled out of a dark deep Dungeon by <hi>caſt clouts and rotten rags</hi> that onely ſeemed fit for the Dunghil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.11, 12, 13.

               </gap> Lord will, my poor weak word
<pb facs="tcp:119940:11"/> may be ſome means to draw Sabbaths and ſacred Ordinances out of thoſe Dungeons of contempt into which they ſeem now to be caſt. And therefore (good Reader) joyn with me in prayer, that a bleſſing from above may abide this book, and that the great God of heaven would go with it from heart to heart, and make it ſome help to this holy Sabbaths and ſervants.</p>

I remember,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.</note> that <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, as an Act of Gods great indulgence towards man, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving written the ten Commandments, <hi>he added no more:</hi> And ſhould not we with obediential ſubmiſsion, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame concerning the Sabbath?
<pb facs="tcp:119940:14"/> Upon the ſecond conſideration, men may without uncharitableneſſe, be cenſured alſo as inexcuſably regardleſſe of their own ſoules good, both in regard of grace and comfort, here and hereafter, who diſreſpect the Sabbath day, which is the <hi>Market-day of the ſoul,</hi> as worthy Mr. <hi>Rich. Rogers</hi> was wont to call it. And that ſmart ſentence (which was miſapplyed unto Chriſt, (for he ſtrictly kept the Sabbath of the Lord his God,) may be applyed to that perſon, who is a wilfull, ordinary profaner of that holy time:<note place="margin">Joh 9.16.</note> 
               <hi>This man is nor of God, becauſe he keepeth not the Sabbath day.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a mans regard, or diſregard of the Sabbath, is his reſpect, or diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto all the reſt of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>Here I might take occaſion to bewail bitterly <hi>Englands</hi> wofull declinings, both in matters of doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, concerning the Sabbath. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, no Reformed Church was ſo famous, either for ſoundneſſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:119940:15"/> or exactneſſe in converſation, in relation to the Lords Day. But our Apoſtaſie began to be Notorious, when the Book for the allowing of ſports, on that day, was promoted, to gratifie the profane and Popiſh party, then predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in <hi>England.</hi> And hereupon many, both Biſhops and others (for alas, how apt are men, even Miniſters among others to ſwim down the tide with them who bear rule?) appeared in the Pulpit, and in the Preſſe, to decry the moralitie and exact obſervation of the fourth Commandment. Many worthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt looked upon <hi>Germanies</hi> Warres as a fruit of this high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there, and they have judged our late-yeares troubles an effect of the like profanation. At this day (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Covenanted Reformation) how wofully is Gods Sabbath neglected every where! and may we not ſay, that the looſeneſſe of them, who are Atheiſtically wicked, is not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to poor <hi>England,</hi> as the carnal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb facs="tcp:119940:15"/> of ſuch, who pretend unto the higheſt pitch of ſanctitie? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even amongſt them, under pretence of Goſpel immunities, and of obſerving every day as a ſpiritual Sabbath, do both take, and plead for that libertie on the Lords Day, which old Puritans (amongſt whom the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhined gloriouſly) did decry and abominate. Many years ſince I heard this ſpeech (uttered with much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) from famous Mr. <hi>John Rogers, Take away the Sabbath, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will ſoon wither.</hi> And is not this too much verified amongſt our ſelves in <hi>England</hi> at this day? We have had, and we have Acts, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Orders, for the better keeping of the Lords Day; but who knoweth not, that the life of the Law, lyeth in the execution? Proclamations and Papers will not pluck down profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, except they be ſtrengthened by the vigorous actings of perſons in power. The Lord threateningly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
<pb facs="tcp:119940:16"/> of the Prieſts in former times, becauſe <hi>they hid their eyes from the Sabbath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 22.26.</note> The meaning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is judged to be, either (more generally) their regardleſneſſe thereof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

This I mention, that we Miniſters may mind our Duties in this regard more. The Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this Uſefull Treatiſe hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed vigorous affections, with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible arguments to awaken, quicken, and encourage people unto the better keeping of the Chriſtian Sabbath. And what conſiderations can be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and conquering unto an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous experienced Chriſtian, then thoſe two, hinted and handled from the Text, which this godly man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh and purſueth to good purpoſe in this preſent Treatiſe, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Chriſt, (whoſe Day, the Sabbath is in a way of ſanctified peculiarity;) <hi>2.</hi> Spirituall

               <hi>I was in the Spirit upon the Lords Day.</hi>

            <p>In the words of the Apoſtle are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable:

                  <item>And his Aſſertion.</item>

            </p>
            <p>That which he ſilently grants, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, yet certainly implyes, is, That there was then a Lords Day in uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which he himſelf in his ſufferings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>That which he poſitively expreſſes, and plainly affirms, is, That upon this Day of the Lord, he was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As there were two brazen Pillars whereupon the burden of <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch was placed, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 7. So the burthen of following diſcourſe ſhall all be brought and layd (through the Lords help) upon two Principall Points.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Point, That even in the times of the Goſpel there hath been, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a day, which is the Lord Chriſts by a peculiar claim.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Point, that ſome of the Servants of the Lord have been, and others may be, in the Spirit on this day of the Lord. The Apoſtle is plain from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords Day.</hi>

            <p>That the Lord Chriſt our dear Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath a day that is peculiarly (His).</p>
            <p>THE LORDS DAY.</p>
            <p>All daies indeed are the Lords. The Lord Chriſt in all daies hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted intereſt, yea, and a double pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for their diſpoſe.</p>

            <p>A derivative property and power as he is Chriſt the Mediator. For as God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119940:23"/> the Father hath put all things, ſo all times into his Son Chriſts hands. We find, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. the whole ſpace of time divided into

            <p>Now there is not a night or day but is the Lords, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 74.16. <hi>The day is thine, the night alſo is thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there is a day which is <hi>THE LORDS,</hi> by an excellency, and in a ſuper-eminent and immediate manner. As we ſee, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50. the Lord ſayes, that all creatures are his; <hi>Every beast of the Forreſt is mine, the cattell upon a thouſand hills, and all the Fowles of the Mountaines are mine,</hi> Verſe 10, 11. But yet thoſe Bullocks and ſheep that were ſet apart for Sacrifice, were more immediately the Lords.</p>
            <p>And thus all time is the Lords, there is not a day in a thouſand years, nor an houre in ten thouſand dayes, but to the leaſt minute, all is the Lords.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a day ſo ſet apart for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervice,</p>

This Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for his ſouls ſolace was as the ſweeteſt flower in all his Garden. This Seventh day God had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>As there was a ſpeciall Tree whereof <hi>Adam</hi> might not eate;</p>

               <p>Forward] As directing to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths further continuance. A day that muſt be remaining.</p>
               <p>Some would make the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be a meer tranſient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, to live and die with the Jewiſh Church: But if they graunt that the other nine are morall and perpetuall, Then this.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119940:26"/> the Ark ſafe to be preſerved? So was I. In reaſons more urgent. In circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more aboundant; more particulars preſſing practiſe, then in any of the other precepts. The whole Decalogue or holy Law of God was delivered in thunder, and the loudeſt and longeſt clap ſeemed to lie upon the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. As if at this the Trumpet gave the largeſt and ſhrilleſt ſound, to ſet it forth and to ſettle it faſt. So we ſee God had for his ſervice (a Sabbath) the ſeventh day.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that our dear Saviour ſhould have ſuch a ſet day of holy reſt and religious labour, as relating to him, ſuits with Scripture, and agrees with grounds of reaſon. For</p>

               <p>Chriſt is to be honoured, as God the Father was.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſame works have been done by Chriſt the Son, as were done by God the Father: <hi>John</hi> 5.19. <hi>Jeſus anſwered. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The Son does nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <p>Firſt, moſt precious is this work in it ſelf, viz. Chriſts recovering ſouls above Gods creating the World. As mans gaining the world cannot recompence the loſſe of his ſoul: ſo Gods making the world does not equalize Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the ſoul. To draw men out of an enthralled bondage, is more then to bring matters out of a confuſed Chaos. In the former God was to deal with no enemy: but in the latter Chriſt was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119940:27"/> put to combate with all the Divells in hell, yea, and to overpower men oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own mercies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moſt preſſing was this work to Chriſt, it made his very ſoul heavy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. In this Chriſt did not onely fight with the Divell, but God herein fought with Chriſt, bruiſed him and put him to grief, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53.10. The worlds creation was done without difficulltie: But the redemption of ſouls was difficult and painfull. To effect the former, God did but ſpeak the word; VVhereas to fulfill the latter, the Lord Chriſt did ſhed his deareſt blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moſt profitable unto us men, is this mighty work of Chriſt. Indeed to have earth to tread on, air to breath in, meat to feed of, light to walk by, are benefits: but the ſubduing the ſtrength of the Divell, the removing the ſting of ſin, with all the aſtoniſhing and ſad ſequels thereof:</p>
               <p>The reconciliatian of Gods anger, and</p>
               <p>The reparation of mans nature:</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like are benefits more abundantly benenficiall. 'Tis a mor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119940:27"/> admirable and andvantagious work for Chriſt to pull brands out of the fire, then for God to bring a world out of the water. After ſuch works then may not Chriſt well require a day of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſt? A Sabbath to be ſanctified for his ſervice one day in ſeven?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſame honour is due to the Son that was done to God the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. All men ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son of God even as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father. In the times of the Old Teſtament, all men did honour the Father with a day of holy worſhip, and was a ſpecial part of his honour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men muſt honour Chriſt the Son, in the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a ſet day for his ſolemne ſervice.</p>
               <p>To Chriſt, for his Honour is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</p>
               <p>The ſervice of the day (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>The day for the ſervice) is his due.</p>
               <p>We find Chriſt honoured by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to him the Word, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. The Sacraments, of Baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. of the Supper, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. So pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

                  <hi>John</hi> 16.23. Yea, the whole Goſpel-Miniſtery; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. Sure then he ought for his honours-ſake to have a Sabbath-day for the exerciſe of all theſe. And are there not as great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in theſe laſt dayes to lay the honour of Chriſt in the duſt, as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to trample down the glory of God the Father? Yea, and far greater: For Chriſt and the things of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As they are much above nature cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
               <p>So they are moſt againſt nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the corruption of nature was never ſo active and oppoſite againſt the dignities of Chriſt, as in theſe laſt daies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>Little Children, it is the laſt time, and as ye have heard that Antichriſts ſhall come, even now are there many Antichriſts,</hi> whereby we know that t'is the laſt time, (or the laſt hour, as in the Greek).

Chriſt being gone up, the holy Spirit he comes down; A bleſſed bargain (ſaith an ancient Writer) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was made betwixt heaven and earth, to triumphing Saints was given the preſence of Chriſts body, and to Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Saints was ſent the comforts of Chriſts Spirit.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119940:31"/> and after his reſurrection, they were the men whom he did commiſſionate to erect a Goſpel-Church, and to order all things therein, and therefore he did continue with them for the ſpace of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes before he aſcended, that he might fully furniſh them for thoſe great appointments wherein he found them faithfull.

Then, then were Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones fain to fly for their lives; yet then were they to be ſerious, and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Sabbath-day-duties, then all Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were aboliſhed.</p>

               <p>Secondly, there be others that carrie Some Sabbath-day-ſhew, they abſtain from their ordinary works, and meet where ſome matters of Religion are managed: but not from any tye upon conſcience, or obedience to any divine Authority. The Papiſts upon an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and others upon a Politicall account, and becauſe of the civill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; otherwiſe in their own opinions, they are ſet Sabbath-free.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119940:36"/> is plain hypocriſie in the Lords Day, and woe to ſuch hypocrites in the Day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I proceed next to conſider them that aſſent ſomewhat to a Sabbath-day: but their aſſent thereunto is not right and through. Of ſuch there be two ſorts.

               <p>Some grant the Lord hath a Day for his ſervice, but they plead againſt the firſt, and for the laſt day in the week (the particular day which the Jewes kept) to be ſtill the ſtanding Sabbath-day. In this is a ſubtile deſign of Satan, when he ſees, as Sabbath-men will have, he ſeeks to ſet it where it may be ſure to fall; and though about this ſcruples may be in ſome conſciencious: yet the principall Patrons for the Jewiſh Sabbbath do it out of a ſecret deſign to lay waſte the Lords Day.<note place="margin">Conatus eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiſſimus eſt retunden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. <hi>Muſc.</hi> Loc: Com.

               <p>Secondly, ſome grant this to be the very Lords Day: but they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'tis a day ſo preciſely to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. As there are few ſo far Atheiſts as abſolutely to deny there is a God: (A God many grant there is, that yet deny the true God, and many acknowledge the true God: that yet cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he is ſuch a God, ſo juſt, holy, pure, and perfect.) Thus there are few ſo far oppoſite to Sabbath as wholly to deny there is any day. A day they yield there is; but then they do not confeſſe the right day, or they do not confeſſe the day aright, a day to be kept, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrict, this they withſtand, whence they are very looſe and take large liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the Lords Day.

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:119940:37"/>
               <p>Some ſo minded for want of better Inſtructions. And ſome ſo minded from the force of baſe Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some have ſtrange latitudes in their judgements of the Lords Day: and indeed the very Doctrine of ſome Churches, and Canons of Synods ſet the door wide, allowing liberty for worldly labour, recreations and ſports upon the Sabbath-day. But theſe are black ſports that blemiſh their beauty in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some who live where they might learn better, the light of the Lords Day in the Doctrine of it, breaking out more bright, and ſhining forth clear and pure: yet they cannot ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the Day, through the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their fleſh, and their dear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgings of their delightful luſts. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they willing to ſee the Sabbaths Sanctity, leſt it ſhould diſturb their ſinful ſecurity. If for the Lords Day they ſhould be ſtrict in their opinions, they could not with conſcience-quiet be looſe in their practice: theſe perſons, in this point of corrupt principles, and

               <p>Firſt, to be free from ſins ſervitude, this implies freedom from death and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, the curſe of the Law, and the wrath of God, the ſequels of ſins ſlavery; Sins ſervice is the ſoreſt bondage. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> Poſition is proper:<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to be free in the ſervice of the Lord is ſweet liberty: this is the caſe of Chriſtians; whatever they do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God as their duty, 'tis under a freetenure, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Grace.

                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> For ſatisfaction herein, we ſhall conſider firſt, That there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between dayes, which it is ſinful for to obſerve. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, That yet there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Sabbath from other dayes, which not to obſerve is ſinful. Sinful it is to obſerve ſuch a difference of days as is Heatheniſh, Jewiſh, Popiſh; the Apoſtle plainly prohibits this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16. Yet by theſe places the Apoſtle doth not forbid a diſtinct obſervance of the Chriſtian Sabbath, for then ſhould he contradict himſelf, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> well obſerves; and others before him clear thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from any relation to the Lords day. Let him bleſſe the Lord, ſayes <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that knowes how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let him thank God who hath learned to diſtinguiſh between ſeveral Sabbaths under the Law, and this Lords day under the Goſpel; they being aboliſhed weare not bound to obſerve them, or to make any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between thoſe dayes, and others
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119940:40"/> of equal concernment. But for the Chriſtian Sabbath, it abides; and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of that day from others we ought to obſerve.</p>
               <p>This is that day ſet apart, By the holieſt Perſon; and, For the holieſt purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Pſal. 4.3. <hi>Know ye that the Lord hath ſet apart the man that is godly for himſelf.</hi> So know ye that the Lord hath ſet apart the day that is holy for himſelf. Here not to diſtinguiſh, is to aboliſh.</p>
               <p>As God will have his Servants to be ſeparated from other men: So he will have his Sabbath to be differenced from other dayes. As men muſt not divide what God hath joyned: ſo men muſt not mingle what God hath ſeparated, or debaſe what God hath elevated.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſerve ſin we ſhould be ever averſe; and O how glad would God's Saints be to keep ſuch a perpetual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119940:41"/> as alwayes to reſt from ſin! and O how ſad have ſome of Gods Saints been, becauſe ſuch a Sabbath comes ſo ſeldome! How does the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>That though with his mind he ſerved the Law of God, yet with his fleſh he ſerved the Law of ſin?</hi> Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> condoles his own condition, Alas, ſin fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows I fly, and yet I fall; I fight, and yet I am captive: I run from it, and yet I am drawn to it; I would reſt, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet one day, one hour, &amp;c. To have ſuch an uninterrupted reſt, as to be every day at a diſtance from ſin, is a very deſirable Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſerve God we ſhould be ever prepared. Though we are not alwayes in Sabbath-day-time, yet our hearts ſhould be alwayes in a Sabbath-day-frame, in ſuch a bleſſed bent as is fit for all holy buſineſſe. Some expound that precept of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,]</hi> Have a continual frame of heart ſit for holy prayer.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a man greatens his ſin, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Sabbath; a man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offends againſt the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, but other Commandements by ſuch ſins are alſo violated, which makes the offence more deep and double. As to be good in evill dayes, is that which heightens a mans praiſe, and declares the eminency of his grace; ſo to be evill on good dayes, ſinfull upon the ſacred Sabbaths of the Lord, is that which makes a mans caſe more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and his ſin the more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Thus a man likens himſelf to Satan, who is ever bad, but worſt upon the beſt dayes. The wickedeſt act that ever the Divell did, was when he met man in the holy place of Paradiſe: and O what ſinfull deſigns hath Satan upon the ſons of men, when he meets them upon the holy time of Sabbaths! Of all ſins ſuch Satan is moſt prone to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that will moſt provoke God, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119940:44"/> ſuch are the ſins of the Sabbath. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Shall I</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an Harlot?

                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well obſerves: that the Sabbath is the Day God appoints to purge and cleanſe men from ſin; and therefore on that day for men to mix themſelves in ſin, is exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in earthly actings there are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119940:44"/> thoſe that ſpend out the Sabbath-Day, ravelling and running out this rich and precious time of the Lords Day.</p>
               <p>Some upon their worldly buſineſſe, &amp;</p>
               <p>Others about their buſineſſe in the world.</p>
               <p>In Sabbath-time are ſome ſet upon their ordinary affaires. As Sea-water it will not abide in its own banks, but beats and eates upon the Land, and drownes the dry ground; ſo many mens worldly callings will not keep within their weeks compaſſe, but eate upon the Lords Day, and drown up Sabbath-time. God in the creation went on through all the works of the World, till he had made man, and then he took his Seventh Dayes reſt, and ſanctified it; how ſad is it to ſee man ſtay in worldly works, and never care to come at God in a Sanctified-Seventh-Days-reſt.</p>
               <p>True, there are ſome who though they will not be in the open Sabbath upon their ordinary week-day-work, yet they will be about ſuch things as have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereunto. We find in the 14. of <hi>Luke,</hi> of ſome that when they were ſent to at Super-time, they made their excuſe: <hi>One ſaid, I have bought a piece of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119940:45"/> ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee: and another ſaid, I have bought five yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them.</hi> The one ſort did not at that very time purchaſe their Farme, but went then to ſee it; nor the other did not then buy their Oxen, but went then to prove them. Thus ſome in Sabbath-time though they are not upon the common work of their Trades, yet then they go to ſee, and are buſie about the diſpoſing of their week-day-works. As God in the Creation wrought out the works of the World in ſix ſeveral dayes, but the very firſt day he fitted and ordered the matter for the whole frame. Thus men upon the firſt day of the week, OUR LORDS DAY, are buſie about the ordering of matters for their earthly affairs in the following dayes. All this proceeds from Satan that evil one, and from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe the root of all evil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Divel upon the Lords day, when he cannot draw to that which is wicked, he will to what is worldly; Thereby

               <p n="2">2. Hereby Satan oppoſes and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Service of God: God upon this account requires (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> excellently notes) men upon the Sabbath to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear their worldly buſineſſe,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that they may then be the more free and full, prompt and ready for religious ſervice; and fot this cauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Divel puts people then upon their earthly buſineſſe, that he may beat them off from Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſervice upon his holy Sabbath day. The Divel does not like diligence in a lawfull calling, but upon ſinful deſigns he unſeaſonably ſets men thereupon. I could report of a poor woman, oft under ſtrong temptations, whom I have heard ſometimes ſadly ſay, ſhe was not able all the week to go about the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary works of her calling, but when the Lords day was, ſhe knew not how to keep from her worldly work, being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently provoked thereunto. True, the more common caſe is for Satan upon the Sabbath to hold men on in their earthly affairs, who are eagerly bent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119940:46"/> thereabout all the week beſides. As the ſubtile Serpent ſaid to <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye muſt not eat of every tree?</hi> ſo Satan ſubtilly ſayes to men; Hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not work upon every day? ye may work, 'twill be for your benefit.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſhould Satan be ſilent, to ſurvile work on the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A principle of covetouſneſſe puts men hereupon: What made <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the tree th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Covetouſneſs, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.5. is called Idolatry; This Idol the world, it takes up that time of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which does belong to God.</p>

               <p>THE LORDS DAY.</p>
               <p>I proceed to a ſecond ſort that ſinne againſt this Lords day, by not doing on the day what they ought.</p>

               <p>Now perſons who do not their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath duties, and ſo ſin againſt this day, are of two ſorts. Some that Idle out the day, and do nothing of the duty, and others that trifle in the day, and of the duty do but ſomething.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Too many are manifeſt, that ſpend this holy day in Idleneſſe. By the Law the Prieſts upon the Sabbath day, were to offer double ſacrifice; whence <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> collects,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>concion. de</hi> Lazaro.</note> that the Sabbath ought not to be a day of eaſe and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but of double diligence in holy

And the Sabbath was the day of his beſt and moſt abundant works, as is well obſerved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Lords day calls for diligence in the beſt duties, and does not indulge Idleneſſe. The <hi>Jewes</hi> uſe to call the ſeventh year the Idle year, becauſe then the ground lay follow, no Plowing, or ſowing, or bringing forth of Corn. Many Chriſtians may call the ſeventh day, the Idle day, for then is no praying, hearing, &amp;c. or bringing forth any fruit that is good, the whole day to the man, and the whole man in the day lyes like the deſert, dry and barren, where no ſeed is ſowen; through Idleneſſe on the Lords day men they become,

But then from prayer and other holy duties to be idle, vacant, and voyd on the Lords day, deepens the ſin, becauſe on ſuch dayes,
<list>
                     <item>Men have beſt work,</item>
                     <item>And moſt work to do.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sabbath is a day of the beſt work. Moſt of the week-work is world-work, poor in compariſon of this. That's like digging in a dark pit, this as reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a pleaſant field. As 'tis beſt being with God: ſo 'tis beſt working for God. Weekly labour is but bodily labour, burdenſome labour; Sabbath-work is chiefly ſoul-work, and all ſweet work. Men work on the week, that they and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119940:48"/> theirs may live well in this world a while: But the Lords Day-work is our meal for ever. Therefore for any to be idle on this day aggravates their ſin of Idleneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Sabbath is a day of the moſt work: men on that day ſhould do more in the ſervice of God then all the week beſides. The <hi>Jews</hi> did much on their Sabbath; Chriſtians are to do more on their Lords Day. If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.9. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.4. we ſhall find that the offerings in the time of the Goſpel propheſied of, were more then thoſe in the time of the Law. In <hi>Num.</hi> we find but two Lambs: but in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> we find ſix Lambs and a Ram for the Sabbath. This ſignifies that in the ſettled times of the Goſpell, Gods Worſhip upon the Chriſtian Sabbath ſhould be ſolemnized more fully then in former times under the Law. Now for men to be idle when they have moſt work to do, cauſes idleneſſe to become the more culpable, and the greater ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to be Sabbath-idle, expoſes ſouls to Satans ſervice: hence ſo many do the divells drudgery, and draw the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119940:48"/> divells cart upon the Lords day. When Satan, eſpecially in Sabbath time, ſees men idle and not about any thing that is good, then he ſoone ſets them about that which is naught: ſo that upon this day men are moſt eager to go on the divels arrand, though to their own ruin. Yea, men upon the Lords Day, that lye idle, they tempt the Tempter, and do invite the Divell to their dwellings, and as it were ask if he hath no work, or what ſervice he will command them. They are ready, each ſaying, Here am I, ſend me. As in ſupper-time Satan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Judas:</hi> ſo in Sabbath-time Satan takes poſſeſſion of ſuch idle ones. Some keep the Sabbath like their cattel, they go not to plow in deed, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good they go about. They are in their houſes as their horſes in ther ſtables: yea, perhaps in their beds as their hogs in their ſtyes. Or on the Lords Day, if they be not as beaſts, they are as birds that flye from place to place: ſo do they wander from town to-town, idly paſſing away of Sabbath-time. Yea, 'tis with many in this, as with the Divells, they believe a Sabbath, but they obſerve no Sabbath: as they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119940:49"/> can keep no Sabbath in point of reſt: ſo they will keep no Sabbath in point of work. Men are on earth as the damned in hell, who never are in any religious duties: they may be crying for water to coole theie tongues: but never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for grace to change their hearts, or for mercy to remit their ſins. For thouſands of idle Sabbaths hath God with ſome to reckon: and let them be fure, that as God will not hold them guiltleſſe that take his Name in vain; ſo God will never hold them guiltleſſe that ſpend his time in vain.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some men they take the one, but then leave the other, and will not let the Lord have his time entire. They ſay of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119940:49"/> the Lords day, as ſhe in the <hi>Kings</hi> of the living child; <hi>Divide it, Divide it.</hi> Yea, they make the time of the Sabbath like the Vaile of the Temple at Chriſts death, to be rent in twain, viz. between the Lord and the World, or which is worſe, between the Lord and their luſts; whereas not a bone of Chriſts body was to be broke, ſo not an hour in his day: As not a member of that, ſo not a minute of this. As our Saviour ſaid concerning the loaves, and the fiſhes; <hi>Gather up the fragments, let nothing be loſt:</hi> ſo he ſeems to ſay concerning his holy Sabbath, Gather up the parcells thereof, let not minutes be loſt, which are precious like the leaſt parings of gold. It hath been perillous to clip a Kings Coyn, tis more dangerous to clip the Lords day. O the dreadful death and doome of <hi>Ananias, who kept back part of the price, and brought onely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part, and laid at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> whereas <hi>before 'twas all in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Act.</hi> 5.3, 4. But this holy time was never ours, nor ever was any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our power, therefore to keep back any hour of this holy day is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death. If no part be the Lords,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119940:50"/> why do you give him any? if the whole be the Lords, why do you put him off with part?</p>

Give me leave (I hope I dote not on any holineſſe of places, but prize the publike gatherings of Gods people, eſpecially upon the Lords Day) to tell you that ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Lord hath had in preceding times, that would pitch upon places of publike worſhip, not onely therein to ſerve the Lord; but to ſuffer for the Lord therein: thither they would run to die, where they uſe to pray: and rather then they would be driven from them, they would be deſtroyed in them, thinking it good going together from thence to heaven. <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports that under the cruell perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> many thouſand Chriſtians were burned in the Temple of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> being aſſembled to celebrate the Day of Chriſt.

               <p>Men muſt alſo beware they bring not a neceſſity upon themſelves, upon the Sabbath to do ſuch things as they might prevent through a prudent foreſight, this is to make a ſin with a neceſſity. <hi>Iſay</hi> 58.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt call the Sabbath a delight, not doing thine own wayes, nor find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine own neceſſities;</hi> ſo ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſing expound the Hebrew word: men have many neceſſities which yet are of their own cauſing, and not of Gods appointing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are things neceſſary in their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119940:58"/> ſeaſon, that yet are not neceſſary upon the Sabbath. 'Tis neceſſary for a man to follow his lawfull calling, and to be diligent in his worldly buſineſſe. When we read (ſayes <hi>Bernard</hi>) that <hi>Adam</hi> in the pleaſant place of Paradiſe was appointed to work, ſhall we think that the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> in the troubleſome Wilderneſſe of this world are placed for play? No, 'tis neceſſary for the ſons of men to be induſtrious in their lawful affairs: <hi>Moſes</hi> putting his hand in his boſome, 'twas leprous; but putting it out, 'twas made whole. God hath given men hands, for a threefold work, ſayes one:</p>
               <p>To lift them up in prayer to God,</p>
               <p>To ſtretch them out in charity to the poor; and</p>
               <p>To put them down by labour in a lawful calling. So that for a man in his lawful calling to labour it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, viz. in its ſeaſon. But herein to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour upon the Lords day is dangerous: The gain of this day may be as the gold of <hi>Tholoſſe,</hi> as the cole brought to the neſt ſetting the young and all on fire. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Reproof is given to <hi>Martha</hi> by our Saviour, for her being about
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119940:59"/> ordinary affairs, aſſuring her that <hi>[One thing was needfull.]</hi> Needfull it was for <hi>Martha</hi> to be about her houſhold buſineſſe. Yea, but not then when Chriſt was preſent, and an opportunity ſerved for ſoul-advantage, which her ſiſter <hi>Mary</hi> minded. Thus though 'tis needfull for Chriſtians to look after their lawfull occaſions in the world, yet not upon the Lords day, the ſeaſon for ſoul-advantages.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are ſuch wordly walks and works neceſſary? and are the works of Gods worſhip arbitrary? yea, upon the Sabbath is not the ſervice of God much more neceſſary?</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>Whether it be more needfull to obey God or men, judge ye:</hi> So ſay I, Whether it be on the Sabbath more needfull to ſerve God or your ſelves, judge ye; whether more needfull to take care for your temporal or your eternal being, judge ye. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong neceſſaries that which is moſt neceſſary, is to be firſt minded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We ſee none ſo exact, our neighbours are not ſo nice, but take their liberties on the Sabbath; and why not we the ſame?</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:119940:59"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt live by precept, not by example; 'tis the Law of God, and not the lives of men that muſt be our rule. As he that will be for God muſt croſſe the moſt of men; ſo he that would go to heaven muſt leave the greateſt part of the world behind him. He ſhall never write a good hand, that makes the world his Copy; nor ſhall he ever well obſerve a Sabbath, who frames himſelf unto the common platforme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If patterns are to bo followed, <hi>Be ye then followers of God as dear children,</hi> Epheſ. 5.1. <hi>In ſix dayes God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and reſted the ſeventh day; wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath-day, and hollowed it.</hi> Likewiſe let us look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16. <hi>He went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, as his cuſtome was, &amp;c.</hi> Learn we ought of Chriſt, though not (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves) to walk on the waters, yet to work in Gods worſhip upon the Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we will take our Model herein after the manner of men, 'tis beſt to look back to preceding Saints. Gods Church and people conſidered as paſt and preſent may be compared to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119940:60"/> that cloud, <hi>Exodus</hi> 14. which was partly bright, and partly dark. The bright part was before, to give light to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the dark part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to blind the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The Saints and people of God aforetime were as the bright ſide of the cloud, ſhining clear in Chiſtianity, ſtrict in all the waies of God, and moſt exact in Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſervice; ſuch as now profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Saints of God, are as the following dark ſide of the cloud, more dim and dull in holy duties, more looſe upon the Lords Day, having leſſe of the life and luſtre of religion. O let us but think what was the care of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not many years ago, to improve Sabbaths, and all the ſervice of God, ſuch follow, with holy Apoſtles and Martyrs, <hi>and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If herein we will take ſuch as are preſent for our pattern, Bleſſed be the Lord, ſome are left, that hold up religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the life; and with great care look to the Lords Day, and the duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

               <p n="1">1. Things Inſtrumental for much good, God removes from men not minding his Sabbaths and ſervice; I mean, the means of grace, the Miniſtery of the Goſpel. A miſerable puniſhment. True; ſuch as have an immediade hand in removing the Word of God preached from a people, are guilty of a very great ſin. And wo, wo, wo, ſayes <hi>Luther</hi> to them that leave the Church without a Preaching Miniſtery, through which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119940:70"/> great Towns of people come to be like dark dens of wilde beaſts. And a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doom it is on ſuch as ſuffer under a famine of the Word of God. Yet ſuch a famine God inflicts for ſinning againſt his bleſſed Sabbath; See <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. ſome ſaying, <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone, that we may ſet forth wheat, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, I will ſend a famine in the land, not of bread, but of hearing the word of the Lord.</hi> 'Twas ill with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when there was no Smith found in all the Land, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were forced to go to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> every man to ſharpen his Share and his Coulter, his Axe and his Mattock, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19, 20. And will it not be ill with <hi>England,</hi> if no faithful diſpenſers of the Goſpel ſhould be found in the Land, but poor people ſhould be put to go to Papiſts, and other perſons of corrupt opinions; thinking thereby to quicken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their dead and ſad hearts, &amp;c. The God of heaven hold off the ſight of ſuch a diſmal day. We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.15, 16. of <hi>Hagar, when the bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the bottle was ſpent,</hi> and her ſon ready to famiſh, <hi>ſhe went and ſate her
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119940:71"/> down at a diſtance, ſaying,</hi> O <hi>let me not ſee the death of my child! And ſhe looked toward him, and left up her voyce and wept.</hi> When Spiritual food ſhall faile, will not a faithful Miniſter ſit down ſorrowfully, ſaying, O let me not ſee the death of my people? Yea, when holy Ordinances are gone, how will other Chriſtian Churches look over to <hi>England,</hi> and lament ſaying, <hi>VVe have a ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts?</hi> Can. 8.8. Theſe are the deſerved effects of our lamentable neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of the Lords day: when men ceaſe from Sabbaths, then God makes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths to ceaſe, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2, 11. Men ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forget Gods Sabbaths, and then God as a puniſhment cauſes Sabbaths to be forgotten, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.6.

               <p>The ſinking of Sabbaths, is the riſing of all errors. Hence we note Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Socinian, Pelagian opinions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed almoſt in every place. With our ſins againſt the day of Chriſt we have ſinful errors againſt the death of Chriſt, againſt the whole Doctrine of Chriſt, Dignity of Chriſt, Deity of Chriſt. I have found ſome affirming, that 'twas a piece of the Divels policy, to hinder the Sabbath from being called (the Lords day,) that he might the more keep men from knowing, and imbracing the Lord of truth, and the truth of the Lord. I dare ſay, 'tis Satans deſign, that he might make men vent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Venomous opinions againſt the pure and precious truths of Chriſt, he cauſes them to become careleſſe in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords day. 'Twas obſerved among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that when they grew remiſſe concerning the Sabbath, they became corrupt in their Tenents touching the works of God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And it may be obſerved among Chriſtians, that ſince men have fallen to ſoul neglects of the Lords day, they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119940:75"/> have about the works of Chriſt redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wax'd wilde in their imaginations; yea, errors of all ſorts hath God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as filthy froggs to infect our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sinful and prodigious practices are alſo plentiful in every place. As the obſervation of the Sabbath is that which brings on all the duties of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ceaſe that, and all ſinks: ſo the violation of the Sabbath is the inlet of al looſeneſſe, a door to all the works of darkneſſe; what wickedneſſe will not riſe up where the Lords day is down? As in the Decalogue the command for the Sabbath is ſet in the middle, being the band of the whole, and that which hath an influence into all: thus in the Catalogue of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. the ſin againſt the Sabbath is ſet in the midſt amongſt them, as being the main, and that through which all the reſt move. Read verſ. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>In thee have they ſet light by father and mother, in thee have they dealt by oppreſſion, in thee have they vexed the father leſſe and the widow. Thou haſt deſpiſed my holy things, and haſt profaned my Sabbath; In thee are men that carry tales to ſhed blood, in thee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119940:75"/> they commit lewdneſſe, thou haſt greedily gained by extortion, and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Now for the Lord in a Land to ſuffer ſuch ſins, is worſe then if he ſhould in an ordinary way puniſh, puniſhment not being ſo great an evil as ſin: Sin is the common cauſe of puniſhment. In evil things the cauſe is more corrupt then the effect; puniſhment is the work of God, ſin is the proper work of the Divel, puniſhment is oppoſite to the peace and quiet of the creature, ſin 'tis repugnant to the very being of man, yea, of God himſelf: 'Tis ſin alone which formally and cauſally ſeparates a ſoul from God the chiefeſt good, and therefore is the greateſt evil: 'Tis ſins that are Bars in Heaven-gates, that there is no entering in; and Bonds in Hell flames, that there's no getting out. If I (ſayes <hi>Anſelme</hi>) were in hell without ſin, I ſhould not be kept in, and were I in heaven with ſin, I ſhould ſoon be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. This (ſayes <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) do I think, and this I will ever Preach, that 'tis worſe by ſin to offend Chriſt, then to be tormented in hell-fire for ever, May not we then well think, that ſin is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119940:76"/> a ſorer evil then any puniſhment poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And therefore, though God does not puniſh perſons for polluting his Sabbath: yet in that he leaves them upon this unto other ſins, their caſe is a thouſand fold worſe. Yet of ſuch too many are manifeſt, men who on the Sabbath do not regard Gods aſſiſting grace to help them in good: God on the week dayes withdraws his reſtrein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace that might keep them from evil, even ſin the worſt of evils.</p>

Another man not far off, this Cherry-time fell from a Cherry-tree, and lay in dreadful dolour all the week, and the very next Lords day dyed. A grown youth upon the Lords day, not

               <p>Prayer;] Upon the Lords day, though one be made the Mouth, yet 'tis meete there ſhould be as many praying hearts, as preſent bodies. Prayer was a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing; the practice of which, the Primitive Chriſtians continued, in their congregated aſſemblies, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſadly complains of ſome in his

               <p>Hearing;] Upon the Lords day a great duty is diligent attention to Gods word read and preached. They (ſayes a reverend Writer) who rightly uſe the Sabbath day,<note place="margin">Gualt. <hi>in Marc.</hi> 3. <hi>Hom.</hi> 23.</note> they go to the publick aſſemblies to hear the holy word of God.

               </p>
               <p>All ought to concur in their care for the keeping of this day. Indeed the Lords day is the Fort-royal of Religion, let all ſtand to it in their places, we be not beaten out of that, eſpecially now, when ſo many lay ſiege thereunto: Some ſet their wits awork, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the doctrinal part of it. Others ſet their wills awork, and impugne the practical part of it; and as they will not reſt on the Lords day, ſo they will not let the Lords day to be at reſt, but mount their Cannons, and make what batteries they can, &amp;c. O let all, and eſpecially ſuch as may do more then others, now beſtirre themſelves to raiſe the Sabbath ſiege, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Sabbath Fort; if we dye, let
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119940:87"/> us dye in a couragious keeping of this, indeed if this be taken, all is loſt; hold this, and yet there is hope. Let us that are in publike places play the men. As the two milch-kine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. being coupled together they bore up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the Arke of God; Thus let Magiſtrate and Miniſter be united to hold up the holy day of God, and the holy worſhip of God upon his day. Let Sabbath-breakers for multitude be like a numerous Army: if Magiſtrate and Miniſter would but joyn, we ſhould route them all: O how commendable were it if theſe two in this regard would agree like <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> his brother, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11, 12. <hi>If the</hi> Syrians <hi>be too ſtrong for me, then thou ſhalt help me: but if the children of</hi> Ammon <hi>be too ſtrong for thee, then I will come and help thee;</hi> onely <hi>be of a good courage, let us quit our ſelves like men, for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi> So let us do what we are able to the utmoſt for the Sabbaths and the ſervice of our God, and then the Lord do with us what ſeems him good. O that thoſe who bear the ſword were fired with ſome of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119940:88"/> that Sabbabth-zeal that once <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had, Chap. 13.17, 18, 19. 'Twas a high praiſe that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gave of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that he was more ſolicitous to preſerve the things of God as a Magiſtrate, then to preſerve himſelf as a man.

Which Lawes were to puniſh the ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with fines of Money, their leaders with baniſhment, the places of their meeting to be forfeited to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and that none of them ſhould have power to beſtow their goods by will, or to enjoy any Legacy to them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119940:88"/> by will bequeathed. And he gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the execution of theſe Laws, and the good ſucceſſe thereof, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Magiſtrate therein. And when people are brought to the publike Pool,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.2, 3.</note> the Miniſter is as the Angel that upon this Sabbath-ſeaſon muſt move and work in the waters, to wit, be active in all the Ordinances of God, that ſuch as by divine aſſiſtance ſtep cloſe in, may meet God for the cure of their ſouls. And as the Miniſter is more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to manage the worſhip of God upon this holy day; yea, his place is to preſſe that men do not on this day of the Sabbath ſatisfie themſelves in a bare bodily way to worſhip God, but to ſee they on the Sabbath ſerve God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth. Thus theſe two as the two Cherubims that looked one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and both upon the Mercy-ſeat, they ſhould with reſpect look one upon another, and both upon the ſervice of the Sabbath, that ſo the Lord may have his day and his due.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let governours of families, Parents and Maſters contribute their beſt aſſiſtance to ſee the Sabbath well
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119940:89"/> obſerved; for which end towards their children and ſervants there is required upon the Lords day a double duty,
<q>
                     <l>A taking of them to the publike means,</l>
                     <l>And a taking with them private pains.</l>

               <p n="1">1. You are to bring them with you unto the publike Ordinances. In the time of the Old Teſtament people that went to worſhip God, <hi>they carried their flocks and their herds with them,</hi> Hoſe. 5.6. that in ſacrifice they might offer them up to God. In theſe times of the New Teſtament, men are to carry their children and ſervants with them to the worſhip of God upon his holy day, offering them up, with themſelves as a ſacrifice to God. When 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that the whole body of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh</hi> people ſhould go out from their dwellings in <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſerve the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Pharaoh called Moſes and ſaid, Go ye ſerve the Lord, but let your flocks and your herds be ſtayed:</hi> but what ſayes <hi>Moſes?

               <p n="2">2. Such of you as are heads of families, muſt upon the Lords day be diligent in houſhold-duties: We find in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Mark,</hi> yea, and likewiſe <hi>Luke</hi> 14. how our Saviour on the Sabbath day, when he had publikely preached to the people as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, he after privately examined his Diſciples, and further inſtructed them as a Maſter of a family. From which example of Chriſt an excellent Expoſitor obſerves,<note place="margin">

               <p>Not that God needs any Sabbath-ſervice, or ſuch holy duties as additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to his Dignity. Indeed as to us the honour of God ſeems to ſink when Sabbaths ceaſe. And the ſupporting of Sabbaths ſeems the advancing of Gods glory; but the intrinſecal glory of God can receive no increaſe. God would be infinitely happy, though men keep no day holy: we need his ſervice, not he our obedience. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſent, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. <hi>to unlooſe the Colt,</hi> the Diſciples were to give the owner
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119940:90"/> this reaſon thereof: <hi>The Lord hath need of him.</hi> We call indeed to a careful keeping of the Sabbath, but we do not ſay the Lord hath need of it. The gods of the Heathen need the ſupports of ſuch as ſerve them; but ſo does not the God of heaven. Hence ſayes the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24, 25 <hi>God that made the world, and all things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is worſhipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things.</hi>

Thus God does not want our ſervice in Sabbaths, neither needs he any of our duties on holy dayes, becauſe of thoſe moſt perfect felicities, and glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that are in himſelf abiding. As the Lord is omniſcient, and needs not any man to aſſiſt his knowledge: So the Lord is all-ſufficient, and needs not any thing to help his happineſſe. And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119940:91"/> therefore the neceſſity of Sabbath-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance does not referre to God: But to obſerve Sabbaths, the neceſſity is in reference to us for a double cauſe, viz.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis neceſſary for us to obſerve the Sabbath day in all its duties, becauſe of Gods injunction. And here 'tis meet of two things to take good notice, to wit,</p>
               <p>Every command of God cauſes a neceſſity of our obodience: and here is a neceſſity of our obedience, becauſe of Gods expreſſe command.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereever God gives a word of command, there is a work of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience neceſſary. I had rather (ſayes <hi>Luther</hi>) obey the Lords commands, then to work Miracles. If Miracles need be wrought, God will do his own work; but 'tis needfull we obey commands, for God will not do mans work. As God by his promiſes binds himſelf to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe mercy: So God by his precepts binds us to perform duty. As God promiſing mercy, requires our faith; ſo God commanding duty, requires our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119940:91"/> obedience. Obedience 'tis a debt which as we certainly owe, ſo we muſt neceſſarily pay. Some they owe to God the debt of paſſive obedience, as they are his priſoners: all, they owe to God the debt of active obedience, as they are his creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119940:92"/> the Law was given: So <hi>Calvin, Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Marlorat,</hi> and other able Writers ſince aſſert upon the ſame text. We are therefore to look upon this ſanctifying the Sabbath, as that for which Chriſt hath given a poſitive Command. 'Twas not a Moſaical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony pointing to Chriſt: but 'tis a Moral duty appointed by Chriſt, and ſo to remain under the Goſpel and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, untill Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to God the Father, and ſet an end to all times and things in this world.</p>

               <p n="1">1. For men in an unregenerate eſtate, they need to have a holy Sabbath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>And of ſuch there are two ſorts;</p>
               <p>Some in a ſinful eſtate, and know it not: and others that know their eſtate to be ſinful.</p>
               <p>And towards both, there's a neceſſity of Sabbaths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For ſuch men as are ſinfull, and do not know it, but are utterly in the darke. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. we find, that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning there was darkneſſe as a black vaile drawn over the face of the deepe, but God upon the firſt day in the week created light, which was exceeding
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119940:93"/> good. God upon the firſt day of the week our Chriſtian Sabbath, creates that good light which ſcatters darkneſſe, that before covered the face of the ſoul, and cauſeth ſuch diſcoveries of things never before ſeen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23 24, 25. <hi>If the whole Church be come together,</hi> [viz. on the Lords day] <hi>there comes in one ignorant, and he hearing the Word, is convinced, is judged, the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt, and ſo falling down he worſhips God, &amp;c.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is one great end of Sabbaths and Sermons, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For ſuch men as know themſelves ſinful, Sabbath-ſervice is neceſſary, that they may conſider how ſad it is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in known ſins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22, 24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.17. For ſome, our Saviour ſayes, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do:</hi> but of ſeveral we may ſay, Father, affright them, they know what they do. They tranſgreſſe Gods Lawes, abuſe his mercies, they oppoſe his Servants, and they know what they do. The former need Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths to convince them of the evil they know not: And theſe latter need Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119940:93"/> to convert them from the evil they know. Yea, to all ſorts of ſinners there's ſuch a neceſſity of theſe dayes and duties, as that there is little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of any ſaving good to the ſouls of ſuch as lay aſide the Lords day: but they who come not within Sabbath-compaſſe, their caſe becomes incurable. Though a man be never ſo diſeaſed and ſick, yet as long as he lyes at Phyſick, keeps his purging dayes, and uſes good means for health, there is hope he may do well; but when he neglects his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling time, lets his diſeaſe run, will not come under the Phyſicians hands, then his caſe growes deſperate, and dye he muſt. Even ſo though a man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſinful, yet as long as he keeps within Sabbath-compaſſe, and comes under the means of ſoul-cure, there is hope he may amend; but if he neglects the Lords day, leaves off holy duties, damne he muſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For men in a regenerate eſtate, the Lords day is of neceſſary uſe; Of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſort we conſider them. Of ſuch

               <p>The ſervice of the Lords day is of neceſſary concernment, to clear truth clouded, to quicken love deaded, and to introduce the duties of a holy life neglected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſtreſſed Chriſtians need Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſuccours. Sabbath-Cordials are required for the recovery of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, and the reviving of droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dying hearts.</p>

               <p>And unto them all the Lords day, is a day of deep concernment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For weak ones, they need Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſupplies, Dayes wherein they may draw near and derive virtue from Chriſt, into all their feeble parts. Dayes wherein as babes from the breaſts of the Lord, they may ſuck in ſoul-nouriſhing milk of grace and mercy to breed them up.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:119940:94"/>2. For ſtrong ones, they need Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſupports, that they may ſtand faſt in their good eſtate and plight. The higheſt and holieſt of Gods Saints ought to be under Sabbath-obſervance, 'tis a reſerve for heavens priviledge to be above Ordinances, and preſent Adminiſtrations. 'Tis the City of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that needs not the light of the Sun, neither of the Moon, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.22. While we live, as we need the Moon, viz. the world with its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and comforts for the bearing up of our bodies: So we need the Sun, viz. Chriſt with his holy times, and things for the well-being of our ſouls. Some ſay of the time that is ſpent upon the ſervice of Chriſt, as they ſaid of the oyntment poured out upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt. <hi>What need this waſte? Matth.</hi> 26.8. But as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>A neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe to me if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. So may every one ſay, A neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe to me if I ſanctifie not the Sabbath. The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Sabbath is as the <hi>[One thing needfull]</hi> to Chriſtians in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and unto the religion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119940:95"/>
'Tis ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> that his life was bound up in the life of his ſon <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin:</hi> So the life of a Chriſtian, and the life of his religion is bound up in the life of Sabbaths. As <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me children, or elſe I dye:</hi> ſo a Chriſtian ſayes, Give me Sabbaths, or elſe I dye. Religion ſayes, Give me Sabbaths, or elſe I die. The Sabbath is as the ſoul of Chriſtian-Religion, if that departs, all becomes as a Carcaſe, upon which the Vermin of corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions prey: 'tis neceſſary then this continue.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>The Matter it will be of,</item>
                  <item>

                  <item>The Seaſon it will be in, and</item>
                  <item>The Sequels that will be thereupon.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The matter the loſſe will be of. In the ceaſing of Sabbaths, a pawſe is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119940:97"/> put unto the precious things of God, as the Goſpel with its glorions admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Was it not a ſad cauſe with the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the ſucklings ſwooned in the ſtreets, and the children cryed to their Mothers, Where is Corn and Wine? And will it not be for poor people pittifull to cry to their Miniſters, Where is the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? Where be thoſe bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments we were wont to find? That was a dolefull day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.3. when <hi>little ones were ſent to the waters, but they returned with veſſels empty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pits were dry.</hi> And will it not be a wofull day for men, women and children to go for the water of the Word whither they were wont, but to return with veſſels empty, for the pits are dry, or full of mud and dirt? [What the preſent ſinking of the ſprings and drying of the ſtreams may mean, I much fear to think.] Will not that loſſe be great, wherein the Word of life is loſt? <hi>What</hi> (ſayes <hi>Luther) is the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word but a dark hell?</hi> And what is a Land without the Goſpel, but a black Lanthorne without a candle? The keeping of the Sabbath hath been the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119940:98"/> honour of our Nation, and the Goſpel the glory of our Land; when the one is down, the other will be gone, and then may we write <hi>Ichabod</hi> upon all our doors. I read of a <hi>Germane</hi> Miniſter, when he ſaw hopes of the Goſpels-paſſage, he cryed out with joy, <hi>Let it come, let it come.</hi> O but to let it go, what bitter cryes will it coſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subject, this loſſe will be to, It will be the ſouls of men will ſuffer ſorely herein. Sabbath-loſſe is a ſoul-loſſe. A ſoul in our Saviours account is of more worth then all the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Even the worſt ſoul</hi> (ſayes <hi>Auſtin) is better then the beſt body.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſayes of man, <hi>he was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man. And ſo</hi> (ſayes <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) the ſoul was not made for the body, but the body for the ſoul which is the better part.</hi> If we loſe health, Wealth, and all the things of the world that relate to the body, 'tis but a little loſſe. But if we loſe the Word, Sacraments, and Sabbaths, it being a loſſe that relates to the ſoul, it is exceeding great.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Seaſon this loſſe is likely to be in, makes it more lamentable. We find
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119940:98"/> it foretold, <hi>Math.</hi> 24, that towards the latter end of the World there ſhould be times of great tribulation. <hi>Nation ſhould riſe againſt Nation,</hi> &amp;c. Ill in ſuch a time to be without Sabbat as: It was wofull for thoſe Virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. when there was a cry at midnight, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom comes,</hi> and then their Lamps were out, and their oil to ſeek. And doleful will it be for thoſe Nations, when they ſhall be in their Nights of Trouble, and hear nothing but cries, Behold, more miſery comes, and then to have their Lamps out, their burning and ſhining lights gone. Have not our hopes been high to ſee Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths more firmly ſettled, the Goſpell more clearly preached, Ordinances more purely adminiſtred, and if after all, all ſhould be daſhed down in the dirt, and we left in the dark, how dreadful would this be? To loſe Sabbaths at any time were ſad but at ſuch a time as this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſequels of the loſſe make it moſt lamentable. Fearfull effects will follow the loſſe of the Lords Day, viz. the deſolating the places of publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.31. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:119940:99"/> 74.4, 5, 6. The Prophet thus ſadly ſighs it out to God: <hi>Thine enemies roar in the midſt of the congregation, they ſet up their enſigns for ſigns.

Let us ſee how liberal the Lord hath been in allowing man ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, viz. ſix dayes, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to himſelf, <hi>[This ONE.]</hi> As <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. ſaid to <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife, <hi>My Maſter hath not kept back any thing from me but thee, becauſe thou art his Wife:</hi> So may each man ſay to the Sabbath, God the great Maſter hath kept back no time from me but thee, becauſe thou art his DAY. We read how under a Parable <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>A rich
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119940:107"/> man that had many flocks of ſheep,</hi> yet when a traveller came to his houſe he ſpared to take of his own, <hi>but took and killed the one ewe-Lamb,</hi> that this poor neighbour had nouriſhed up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This aggravates the ſin of many a man, when a temptation comes to his heart, and buſineſſe he is to go about, he ſpares to take of his own time, though he hath ſeveral dayes, but takes of this ONE DAY which God hath ſet out for himſelf. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. <hi>There are ſix dayes wherein men ought to work in them, therefore come and be bealed, but not on the Sabbath day.</hi> So ſay I, There are ſix dayes for lawfull labour; in them men may go and trade and travel, but not on the Sabbath day. What ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat and drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi> So I ſay: What have ye not nights to ſleep in, and have ye not dayes to buy and ſell in? and have ye not time to recreate and take any lawfull delights in? but pollute ye the day of God? Seeing 'tis but one day in ſeven, how unwearied in holy workings ought we to be? As Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples when
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119940:107"/> he found them aſleep, <hi>Could ye not not watch with me one hour?</hi> So will the Lord ſay to ſome at the laſt and great account, Could ye not work for me one day? Seeing the Lord hath been ſo bountiful as to give us ſix daies for our neceſſary concernments in the World, he may well claim our cloſe attendance upon this one day. God might (as one well obſerves) have required all dayes to be ſpent in the works of his worſhip,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pet.

Had all time been ours, then if God had taken out one whole day for himſelf and his ſervice, and left us ſix, we might have made ſome exception: But when all time was Gods, ſo that for men to have a minute is a mercy: yet to have ſuch a plentifull portion as ſix-days-time of God every week, with ſo ſmall a reſerve to himſelf, is well worthy of wonder.</p>
               <p>But O how much more to be admired is God in his goodneſſe towards us of this Nation, and eſpecially in theſe parts thereof, in ſettling amongſt us for ſo many years ſuch Sabbath-Helpers, and Helps for Sabbaths! Should we go into many parts of the Chriſtian world,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119940:108"/> yea, into divers parts of this Land we might ſee poore people ſitting of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths deſtitute. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6, 7. 'tis ſaid to ſome, <hi>Is it not the eleventh hour? Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? they ſaid, Becauſe no man hath hired us.</hi> Thus might it be ſaid to ſeverall, Is it not the Sabbath? why walk you about, or ſit you at home all the day idle? They may anſwer, Becauſe we have no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to preach to us. For want of the Miniſtery of the Word, in many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this Land, the Lords Day lies dead and buried, the generality of people running into Atheiſme, ready for Pope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, and all Soul-poyſoning opinions; yet God is good to us, and gives us Sabbath-ſupplies, Sermons in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: Week-day-lectures, as preparatives to Sabbath-day-labour, and preſervatives of Sabbath-Day-life, to keep up quickenings in Chriſtians, that what they gain on the Lords Day, they may not loſe in the week.

               </q>

                     <item>By glorious Exerciſes on it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ordinances God hath put into
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119940:111"/> the day, adds to its honour. A ring that is it ſelf gold, is of value; but put a precious Diamond into it, the weight and worth thereof is greater. Take a plot or parcel of ground that is it ſelf good, yet if there be rich Woods, Springs, and Mines in it, coſtly houſes, and ſtately buildings on it; this raiſes the price. Thus is the Sabbath it ſelf holy, and highly to be priz'd. O but the rich treaſures of Ordinances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath adorned the day, draw up the dignity of it. Yea, upon the Sabbath day there is not onely ſome ſingle Ordinance, but the Ordinances of God gathered; as then there is a meeting of good Chriſtians at the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: So then there is a meeting of Ordinances for the good of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Prayer ſayes to Preaching, Come and help me. The Sermon ſayes to the Sacrament, Come and help me. Upon this day they all joyn, which is indeed the honour of the day. <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> commanded <hi>Mordecai</hi> to be dreſſed in all his brave attire, and to have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man the King delights to honour.</hi> The Sabbath, 'tis dreſſed up with all the rich
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119940:111"/> attire, and ſtately furniture of glorious Ordinances, that we well may ſay, Thus ſhall it be done unto the day that God delights to honour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us ſee what God for a further honour hath done upon this day. Upon this day God hath commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, brought many a dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave: upon this day God hath of ſtones raiſed up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of Lions made Lambs to God, out of ſinful men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted thouſands of ſouls to the faith of Chriſt. Upon this day God hath made the blind to ſee, the deafe to hear, the dumbe to ſpeak, and the lame to walk. Whereas the works of the firſt Creation were all done upon the ſix dayes, and none upon the ſeventh which was the Sabbath-day. All the works of the new Creation are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily done upon the Sabbath day, rather then upon any of the ſix dayes. This, this hath been the Birth day of many ſpiritual Kings and Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.5. <hi>And of</hi> Zion <hi>it ſhall be ſaid. This and that man was born in her.</hi> And of the Sabbath it may be ſaid, This and that man was born therein. O bleſſed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119940:112"/> day! Millions of Saints in heaven they bleſſe this day of God, and they bleſſe God for this day. I read of one that curſed the day of his Birth; but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of any that curſed the day of his New Birth. This is the day of reſcuing the prey from the mighty, the day of opening the Priſon-dores, and ſetting the captive free. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. <hi>It is a night much to be obſerved to the Lord for bringing them out from the Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>This is that night of the Lord to be obſerved of all the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their generations.</hi> So may we ſay of the Sabbath, 'Tis a day much to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Lord for bringing ſouls from the bondage of ſin. This is the day much to be obſerved to the Lord of all the children of God throughout all generations. This hath been the day of many a ſpiritual Marriage, or the day of Gods eſpouſing many ſouls to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus hath God honoured this his holy day highly. And as for this holy day, it doth highly honour God, exalting all that appertains to God;
<list>
                     <item>It beautifies the ſervice of God,</item>
                     <item>It dignifies the ſervants of God.</item>

               <p>So ſeveral ſound Expoſitors upon the place. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Words ſpoken in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are like apples of gold in pictures of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Thus Prayers made, and Sermons preached in ſeaſon, are as golden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in ſilver pictures, one helping to honour the other. The golden apples grace the ſilver pictures, and the ſilver pictures ſet out the golden apples. Thus the Sabbath-ſervice advances the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſeaſon, and the Sabbath-ſeaſon exalts the Sabbath-ſervice; and all lifts up the honour of God, who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſilver diſhes for golden apples, and put golden apples into ſilver diſhes. Appointing bleſſed dayes for ſacred duties, and ſacred duties for bleſſed dayes.</p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:119940:113"/>2. Hereby the ſervants of God are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. God in giving the whole Law, and ſo in proclaiming the Command for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, made uſe of the Miniſtery of Angels, not for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to him, but dignity to them. 'Twas an honour to the Angels to be preſent and aſſiſtant when the Sabbath was ſet forth, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3.19.. Thus God in the continued management of the Sabbath, and carrying on the ſanctification thereof in the world: makes uſe of the Miniſtery of men as a dignity to them. Among other reſpects there are two moſt remarkable things that do dignifie the office of Miniſters above all other Functions:
<q>
                     <l>The ſubject they are imployed for, viz. The Souls of men,</l>
                     <l>And the Seaſon they are imployed in, viz. The Sabhaths of God.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Other callings their work lies upon the week-daies, but the Miniſter in his buſineſſe lies bound for the Sabbath. O let not any earthly diſcouragements ſink the ſoules of my dear brethren: but let's honour that God who hath ſo honoured us, as to bend and bind our buſineſſe to this bleſſed Day. Hath
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119940:113"/> God magnify'd our office to labour on this day? Let us magnifie our office by this days-labour. <hi>Steadfaſt, immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, abounding in the Lords work</hi> upon the Lords day.

               <p n="2">2. The Sabbath conſider'd as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, hath honour.

Had he not riſen from the dead, he had never aſcended into heaven, never ſat down at the right hand of God. And therefore his riſing day, may well be our reſting day: that day on which Chriſt took the firſt ſtep to all his great honours, is an
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119940:114"/> honourable day, and a day much to be honoured. God hath highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this day;</p>
               <p>As by converting on it the Souls of men,</p>
               <p>So by raiſing on this day the Body of his Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may ſee this days excellency in its permanency. As the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was more excellent then the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe of its order for ever, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.17. So the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Chriſtians is more excellent then all the Sabbaths of the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it continues. To this Sabbath it might be ſaid in regard of all the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Sabbaths, <hi>They ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt, and they ſhall all wax old as doth a garment. As a veſture ſhalt thou roul them up, and they ſhall be changed; but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall not fail.</hi> Heb. 1.11, 12. To this day all the powers of earth &amp; hell ſhall never put a period.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may look into the large dignity of this Day,

But that which is more meet for us to conſider, is the ſettling of our Chriſtian Sabbath upon the firſt day of the week. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.23. we read how 'twas <hi>written in the Law, that every Male that firſt opened the womb, was called holy to the Lord:</hi> our Sabbath it is that day which firſt opened the womb of time, that day which firſt opens the womb of every week: and therefore may well be kept holy to the Lord, and be accounted honourable in the world. Whereas the <hi>Jewes</hi> Sabbath was upon the laſt, ours is upon the firſt day of the week. So that the Jewiſh Sabbath might well ſay concerning the Chriſtian, as <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt of Chriſt, <hi>There comes one after me, that is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before me:</hi> 'Tis more excellent as 'tis time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Sabbath as it is named, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends in excellency. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. 'tis ſaid
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119940:115"/> of Chriſt in reſpect of the Angels: <hi>He hath obtained a more excellent name then they;</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of our Sabbath in reſpect of all the Judaicall Sabbaths, It hath obtained a more excellent name then they, it is called</p>
               <p>THE LORDS DAY.</p>
               <p>True, there is excellency in the name (Sabbath) as it ſignifies reſt. Reſt is the Centre to which all living creatures move. Reſt is the perfection and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all creatures after their tyring and troubleſome motions: But in this name excellencie more abounds,</p>
               <p>THE LORDS DAY.</p>
               <p>As it made much for the honour of <hi>Jacob</hi> when he had another name ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Iſrael. Jacob</hi> ſignified, The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planter of weak man: <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſignified, The prevailer with a ſtrong God. The latter the far more excellent name. This is the honour of the Sabbath, it hath another name, and the former was not like this laſt.</p>
               <p>THE LORDS DAY.</p>
               <p>There is admirable excellency in all that is called the Lords.</p>

               <p n="1">1. To debaſe and deſpiſe the Lords day is common now in our Nation. Men for the moſt part make no more of this then of any other day, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> ſay they to the Church extolling of Chriſt. Upon this ſhe fell to a more full diſcovery of the dignities and excellencies of Chriſt. Some had
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119940:117"/> need ſet up Gods Sabbath-honour the more, there are ſo many that ſay in their hearts, What is the day of the Sabbath more then another day? yea, and indeed it is no more, as many in their lives ſinfully make it. <hi>Dalilah</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon <hi>Sampſon, he loſt his locks and his ſtrength, and became like another man.</hi> The Devil with divers hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far againſt the Sabbath, that it hath loſt its life and luſtre, glory and honour, and is become like another day; which I am ſure is no ſign of good to come. Some ſay, that if the Sun which is the chief of planets be Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it ſignifies great Commotions, Mutations, Deſtructions. I dare ſay, that when the Sabbath which is the chief of dayes, is clouded and covered over with black opinions and practices, it intimates heavy evils to come. O how do men pollute that which God hath ſanctified! and debaſe that day which God hath dignified! <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15. <hi>What God hath cleanſed, call not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And what God hath honoured O man, account not thou baſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To advance this day is its due, and our duty; And indeed could we in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119940:118"/> 
                  <hi>England</hi> but recover the Sabbaths ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that this Sabbath-Sun might ſhine again in its beauty and luſtre, and our Horizon be filled with the bright beames thereof, it would remove the fogs of filthy errors, prevent the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſad calamities, regain the credit of contemned Ordinances, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. as there the Lord of the Sabbath ſaid. <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to me:</hi> So may the Sabbath of the Lord ſay, <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all to me.</hi> Then all the things of God ſhall riſe. As when Chriſt was riſen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52. <hi>Many bodies of Saints which were aſleep in their graves, aroſe and went into the holy City, &amp;c.</hi> Thus were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath raiſed, the whole body of Chriſtian Religion would be brought out of its grave, and many of Gods Saints that are as it were now aſleep upon the beds of ſad ſeducing errors, would ariſe and come forth to the holy ſervice of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. 'tis ſaid of ſome Mothers, <hi>that they received their dead children raiſed to life again.</hi> O what joy would it be to poor Miniſters, that they might receive again ſome of their ſpiritual children as alive from the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119940:118"/> dead! Such things would be, were Sabbaths raiſed in their honour, that lye now under the worlds contempt. Indeed as the Lord in the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Son of man, can theſe dry bones live? And I anſwered, O Lord God, thou knoweſt. Then ſaith the Lord, I will cauſe breath to enter, and the dead bones ſhall live.</hi> May not the Lord ſay, Can my dead Sabbaths live? Can my dry Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances be green, juicie, and ſappy again? Lord, thou knoweſt. O would but God breath from above, and bring his Sabbaths up from below, then would come on that <hi>FIRST RES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECTION!</hi> O that I might live to ſee ſomewhat of this! As there hath been a certain day of the Lords Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Oh that there might be a ſpeedy reſurrection of the Lords day! A day for the recovery of whoſe life, all ought to labour. A day for the clearing of whoſe honour, all ought to be earneſt. A day that above all dayes ought to be had in very high eſteem. This for the Excellency.</p>

Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Stand ſtill, &amp; ſee the ſalvation the Lord will ſhew to day: for that very day God drowned the</hi> Egyptians <hi>in the water of the Red-ſea,</hi> &amp;c. The Sabbath is the day wherein God ſaves ſoules from their ſins, drowning their corruptions this day in the Red-ſea of Chriſts bleſſed blood. Or if ſin does not immediately die; yet it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a Sabbath-wound, as it ſhall never recover, but as the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> wax weaker and weaker, till all comes to an utter end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sabbath 'tis good againſt the evil of puniſhment, and all kinds of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. When Judgements deſolating are up and down, O 'tis ſafe being in a Sabbath-ſanctuary: when enemies are black and bloody, the Sabbath of God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119940:121"/> will bring the God of the Sabbath to be on our ſide. <hi>Luther</hi> reports of a Biſhop of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> who being told that a Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> prepared warre againſt him, anſwered, <hi>My care ſhall be to reform the Church and amend what is amiſſe in the Sabbaths and ſervice of God, and God will fight for me: Which when the Duke heard, he disbanded his forces, ſaying, he would not contend with that man, that engaged God in his quarrel.</hi> Let who will reſolve warre againſt us, this dayes reforming, would prevent the Lands ruining. Indeed while Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is languiſhing, Nations are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; while Sabbaths are ſinking, Cities are ſhaking: O what a controverſie hath God! O what a fire did God threaten within the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the breach of his bleſſed day! <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.27. Breakings of Sabbaths, brings burning of Cities.

               <p>Yea, beſides ſuch more common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, ſome by Sabbaths-meanes are brought to a ſoul-ſaving change. In that glaſſe of the Goſpel which this day is held up, ſome <hi>beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. This is the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the net is caſt out, that drawes many to ſhore. Yea, fiſhes that could never be caught, are brought in by a Sabbath-tyde. Through the warme beames of a Sabbath-ſun ſome new creatures are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, that were before but as filthy dung. Such ciences of ſaving graces are graffed into the ſoules of ſome upon the Sabbath-day, as that after they prove trees bearing the beſt fruit, who were before but as Crab-tree-ſtocks.</p>

               <p>Such as are fallen through ſin are ſet
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119940:126"/> up through Sabbath-helps. The helps of a Sabbath have recovered decayed Chriſtians, impoveriſhed places and perſons have been relieved by Sabbath-Collections, and ſo by Sabbath-peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have ſome had ſweet relief who were ſunk low in their ſouls eſtate. Nothing better by way of means, then holy Ordinances upon the Lords day to recover ſoul-Conſumptions. Some that have been as <hi>Aarons</hi> dry Rod, yet through this dayes bleſſing, have bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom'd and born abundance after of the beſt fruit. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. we ſee our Saviour upon the Sabbath day healing of a man that had a withered hand.

               <p>Yet we hope that in ſome of them there is ſome life left, and that the Lord will ere long raiſe and recover them through tht benefit of this bleſſed day. Others that have not yet fallen, the Sabbath is of ſingular uſe to ſettle them faſt. 'Tis conceived by ſound Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from ſeveral grounds, that our firſt Parents fell from their created In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, upon the ſixth day of the week, the very ſame day wherein God had made them: Should they have ſtood up, and poſſeſſed out the ſervice of the enſuing Sabbath, they would have been more ſettled in their obedience, and better confirmed for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but Satan ſubtilly aſſaults them before the Sabbath, or the ſeventh day comes, and ſo more eaſily were they conquered, and caſt down. The Sabbath with the ſervice thereof is ſoul-quickning, Saint-ſtrengthening. The Chriſtian Sabbath is the main ſinew of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119940:127"/> Chriſtian Religion; if this be ſtopt or obſtructed, and vital blood does not well paſſe, all the parts weaken, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, waſte and die: but if all paſſes well in Sabbath-veines, then all grows and gathers ſtrength, and is more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, lively, and laſting. Sabbaths ſerve to make the Saints of God more pure, perfect, and permanent. That's holy which the Sabbath ſanctifies, and that is ſtrong which rhe Sabbath ratifies, and that is bleſſed upon which paſſes the bleſſing of the Sabbath. Some Collect from <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. &amp; 27. that the Lamb appointed for the Paſchal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was not allowable before it was eight dayes old: And ſome of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins render this reaſon, becauſe nothing in the world was to be reputed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, untill a Sabbath had paſſed over it; but then was a thing clean, compleat, and bleſſed, when it had gone under the bleſſing of a Sabbath. Yea, ſuch is the benefit of this bleſſed day, that as it brings all things to be bleſſed to us: ſo it brings us to be in all things bleſſed, <hi>Iſay</hi> 56.2. Yea, all things that concern our good, not onely for time, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are brought in at this Sabbath-door,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119940:128"/> 
                  <hi>Iſay</hi> 56.5. As <hi>Caleb</hi> gave his daughter the upper and the lower ſprings: ſo God hath given his day the good things both of Earth and Heaven. Thus the careful keeping of Chriſtian Sabbath is profitable.</p>

               <p>Ai, Ai, but that which was pleaſant for her ſight, it was perillous for her ſoul.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119940:139"/> eſpecially upon the Lords day, ſhould be drawn out, ſo as that what comfort we cannot by ſenſe perceive, we ſhould by faith believe. Becauſe we ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee not our ſelves ſucceſſeful in our ſervices, ſhall we think God is unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his promiſes? In promiſes God hath engaged himſelf certainly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a good man for all that good ſeed, which he upon the Sabbath ſowes. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall be a ſure reward,</hi> Prov. 11.18. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſincere every Sabbath day, he ſowes the ſeed of joy, and God will aſſuredly reward him with the ſweeteſt fruits of joy. And though he hath not comfort in his way, yet he is in the way of comfort. For as God hath bound man to tranſact Sabbath-duties; ſo he hath bound himſelf to vouchſafe Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-mercies. And though upon this day, mans diſcharged duties may not leave in his ſoul the ſenſe of ſweet delight; yet Gods engaged mercies, they lay the ſure grounds of ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his ſoul. And as none ſhall receive the mercies, but who performs the duties: So whoever faithfully performs the duties, ſhall aſſuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119940:139"/> the mercies. And the leſſe mercy good men meet for preſent, the more is to come. Many men upon the Lords day do the works of the Devil, yet for preſent they have no puniſhment of body, no perplexity of ſoul. Ai but there is the more terror and torment to come. So there are ſome of Gods Saints moſt ſerious in the ſervice of the Sabbath, that yet have no ſenſible peace, no ſoul-ſatisfying comforts. There is the more plenty of peace and comforts to come. Chriſt in the great work of mans Redemption by his death and ſufferings, his ſoul was in ſorrowes, yet there was joy ſet before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Looking to Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy ſet before him endured the Croſſe, deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Chriſtians who ſeek to ſanctifie the Sabbath, yet can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own ſadneſſe and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, however there is joy ſet before them, which may ſupport them againſt all deſpondency, and encourage them in the courſe of their duty. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.5 6. <hi>Maſter,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Simon</hi> to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>we have fiſhed all night, and caught

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119940:140"/> thinking of the late deadneſſe of the Sabbath-womb, how few births have been brought forth for God upon this day! nor ſo ſit thinking of the badneſſe and barreneſſe of their own hearts as to break off, or not to bear up in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of this bleſſed day! Yet <hi>Sarah</hi> may be fruitfull, and an <hi>Iſaac</hi> may be born; yet the Sabbath may be ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and their ſouls joyful. O, brethren, yet be ſtedfaſt, immoveable, abiding, and abounding in the Lords work upon the Lords day, your labour ſhall not be in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for them that have drunk deep of the ſweetneſſe of Sabbath-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, but now find ſome bitter drops to fall from thoughts of fear, leſt the preſent publick uſe of Sabbaths ſhould ceaſe; Let ſuch conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if in the Land our publike li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties on the Lords Day ſhould be loſt, and the Sabbaths of God be as it were carried into captivity; yet it would not be long before their return. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great Queſtion, about which are ſuch various apprehenſions, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the witneſſes or no be as yet ſlain? ſhould we determine the negative, yet
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119940:141"/> after their death it is not long before their reſurrection will be, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.11. And then dead Ordinances, dead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, dead Sabbaths will be aſſuredly raiſed to their primitive life, and luſtre. O let me not live to preach the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sermons of Englands Sabbaths! that would be a dark day. When as the Lord of the Sabbath dyed, darkneſſe was over all the Land for ſome few hours: And ſhould the Sabbath of the Lord die, darkneſſe might be over all the Land for ſome few years. Thoſe ſtrange aſtoniſhing turnings which we have ſeen in our times, whether they tend to the overturning of the holy times and things of God, God knows. Should we have our deſerts, and ſome their deſires, there would ſoone be ſeen a ſad ſinking of Sabbaths. Should ſome ſucceed in their deſigns, yet the Day of God might ſay, as the Church of God, <hi>Mieh.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I ſhall ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and 'tis hopeful it would not be long after its falling, before it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. We are in the laſt; times, wherein God, as he hath great works to do, ſo great works he may permit men to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119940:141"/> do, yet in all he will have quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches. Should the Goſpel-Sabbath, and the Goſpell with the Sabbath be beaten down in England, yet mangre the might and malice of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we have ſome grounds to hope, it would not be long, before the Lord lifts them up again. The time for the converſion of the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſubverſion of the Antichriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> now draws nigh, for the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of whoſe external part, God will make uſe of Externall Powers. And it appears by conſulting <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. that theſe Nations of Europe who have taken part with the beaſt, and born her up, ſhall beat her down. The moſt Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox that I meet, make England one of thoſe ten hornes, which ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire. Now ſure it will be Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, beſet with Sabbaths that ſhall ſend out, and be aſſiſtant in this Service. When <hi>Joſhuas</hi> ſhall be forth abroad with their armies in the valleys, many <hi>Moſes's</hi> ſhall be at home in the mount, eſpecially on the Lords Day, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying with hands lifted up
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119940:142"/> unto the moſt High God: then ſhall be the ruine of this Romiſh <hi>Amalek,</hi> this day drawes near. I think indeed it is impoſſible punctually to determine the time of <hi>Romes</hi> finall fall, except we could be exact in the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts firſt originalls: but certain that time does apace approach. Therefore ſhould any party acted by the Spirit of Antichriſt, for a time interrupt the Lords Day, and oppreſſe the precious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof: yet they ſhall not long prevail, they ſhall prove but as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Julians</hi> power, <hi>A cloud that will preſently paſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed ſhould Sabbaths fail and fall, in reſpect of ſinfull men (as I have ſaid before) there would be grounds of great fear, that it might be a long time before God returns them: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of good men, there is and will be good grounds of hope, God will ſhorten that ſad time: <hi>For the Elects ſake thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortened,</hi> Matth. 24.22. Our Saviour there ſpeaks of ſuch a ſad time, as even upon Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days, there might be ſuch dangers, that men inſtead of reſting and ſerving God, they ſhould then be running to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119940:142"/> preſerve themſelves, verſe 20. Ai but ſuch a time ſhould not be long. For the Elects ſake God would cut it ſhort; Indeed as the leaſt time of the Lord of the Sabbaths abſence: So the leaſt time of the Sabbath of the Lords hinderance to gracious hearts will be grievous long. <hi>Bernard</hi> upon that ſaying of our Saviour. <hi>John.</hi> 16. <hi>Yet a little while, and ye ſhall ſee me: and a little while, and ye ſhall not ſee me. A little while, Lord? (ſays he) A little while? Thou canſt not be gone the leaſt while, but it will be a long time.</hi> So the Sabbath cannot ceaſe the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſeaſon, but the time to Gods Saints will ſeeme exceeding long: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time which in it ſelf and to others would indeed be long, God for their ſake makes it ſhort.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The clearer upon the Sabbath we can ſee God, the better will our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivings be.

               <p>The matter of the comforts wherein the ſoul of a Saint may upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath aſcend, is exceeding high.

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods holy day men find onely their own pleaſure, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13. But Gods Saints can find ſoul refreſhing comforts in Chriſt the Lord, upon the Lords day. With delights in the Lord their hearts leap. Yea, and the meaſure of their comforts may mount their minds ſo high upon this holy day, as to make them to be like <hi>Moſes</hi> upon mount <hi>Piſgah, viewing Canaan flowing with milk and hony.</hi> The ſoul of a ſincere Chriſtian upon the Sabbath may be as it were ſwimming in a Sea of ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119940:159"/> unto the Land of promiſe. He whoſe heart hath been as a Boat that could not be got up becauſe of low water all the week, yet it hath been brought up in a high ſpring-tyde of ſpiritual comfort upon the Lords day.

               <p>Breadths of comfort.] Upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath the pious ſoul ſpreads it ſelf in ſweet delights, God having given to a good man for his comfort, as <hi>Caleb</hi> did to his Daughter, <hi>the upper and the lower ſprings.</hi> A Chriſtian in his lower comforts the further he goes, the narrower they grow, and the leſſer they be: but in his comforts upward, the higher he riſes, the greater are their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes: when he is moſt lively let in, they are moſt largely let and laid out. Sabbath comforts may be exceeding broad:

               <p>Into comforts are made all things that meet the ſoul of ſome Saint in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Sabbath: The croſſes of the world are the encreaſes of comfort. <hi>Gods rod and his ſtaffe cauſe comfort,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. <hi>As ſufferings abound, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations abound,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. The more outward troubles, the more inward tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. The Apoſtle was never ſo in the Spirit of comforts, as when he was a priſoner at <hi>Patmos.</hi> Under his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confinements he had his ſweeteſt enlargements. His every day-afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons encreaſed his Sabbath-comforts. To his ſoul nothing was ſad when the Sabbath came. Yea, upon the Lords day a believer being in the Spirit, the worſt evils greaten the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Sin remitted, Hell removed, Death vanquiſhed, Divel conquered, do all encreaſe his comforts. Out of every eater comes meat. <hi>He gathers grapes of thorns, and figs of thiſtles.</hi> Upon <hi>Sodom</hi> (ſayes <hi>Salvian</hi>) God rained hell out of heaven. Upon the Sabbath God
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:119940:160"/> to his Saints raiſes Heaven out of Hell. Hell, Divel, Death, Sin, Croſſes, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, all encreaſe their Sabbath-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Comforts of differing ſorts receive a Sabbath-change: Earthly comforts are made heavenly, thoſe delights that lye in worldly relations, poſſeſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, creature-accomodations and contents, in the Spirit are made ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. As a man in carnal comforts makes all comforts carnal: ſo a Saint in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual delights makes all delights ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The upper and lower ſprings run all into one ſtream, and upon the Lords day become all as of one kind. Comforts of differing ſeaſons are brought within the Sabbath-compaſſe. A Chriſtians caſe becomes ſuch,
<q>
                     <l>That in Spirit good paſt is then with him preſenr,</l>
                     <l>And good future he is then preſent with in Spirit.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Things paſt come in for comfort at preſent. <hi>Luther reports, that ſometimee,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:119940:160"/> and eſpecially upon a Sacrament-day, the death of Chriſt was as full and freſh upon his ſpirit, as if he were then at mount</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary, <hi>and as if that were the very day and hour wherein our dear Lord died:</hi> Thus a Chriſtian may be ſo in the Spirit of comfort upon the Sabbath-day, as if that were the very day when Chriſt broke the bars of the grave, flung the ſtone off the Sepulchre, <hi>and roſe again from the dead.</hi> Or as if it were the very day when with the holy Apoſtles he ſtood and ſaw the Lord Chriſt taken up into heaven, to ſit down at the right hand of God. Now to his comfort he can recal the comforts found in former dayes and duties. That very Sabbath his ſoul comfortably poſſeſſes all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chhiſt. He ſees as it were the Lord opening his bowels, his boſom, and drawing out both breſts of his bleſſed Word and Sacraments, bidding his ſoul ſuck, and be fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And unto things future he comes for his preſent comfort. Not onely as at a diſtance a believer may look at heaven, and the felicities thereof, but his ſoul in the Spirit of comforts may be ſo carried out, as if heaven were already
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:119940:161"/> poſſeſſed. 'Twas a brave expreſſion of the Martyr to his cruel tormentors: <hi>Work your will upon my weak body, as for my ſoul it is in heaven already, and over that Caeſar hath no power.</hi> And as ſuch may be a Chriſtians caſe in the day of his ſufferings: ſo may it be in THIS DAY of his ſervice. <hi>Jerom</hi> profeſſes that he had ſometimes found things ſo with himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hieron.</hi> in lib. de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. <hi>Seru.</hi>
                  </note> that it ſeemed to him, as if he had been triumphing among Troops of Angels, and ſinging <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> with the Saints in heaven; Yea, walking arme in arme with Chriſt in the Galleries of eternal glory. The Apoſtle is to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>I know a man in Chriſt above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I cannot tell, or out of the body I cannot tell, God knowes; ſuch a one caught up into the third heaven. And I knew ſuch a man, whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell, God knowes; how he was caught up into Paradiſe, &amp; heard unſpeakable words,</hi> &amp;c. This of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> does import the higheſt pitch of a perſons being in the Spirit. And of ſuch a being in the Spirit the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> does here ſpeak his experience,
<q>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</q>

               <p>That his Spirit hath onely a ſympathy with them,</p>
               <p>And they onely can ſatisfie his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>The ſympathy of a good mans ſpirit is with the things of Chriſt. His heart hath a kind of Antipathy to things of an other nature, Even the things of the world his Spirit oppoſes, refuſes, riſes, if of them any tenders be to take him off from Chriſt. When <hi>Valence</hi> the Emperour ſent to <hi>Baſil</hi> the offer of great preferments, the good mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was up in an anger, and made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Let him offer theſe ratles to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not to Chriſtians.</hi> When ſome bade ſtop <hi>Luthers</hi> mouth with prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one of his Adverſaries anſwered, <hi>It is no boot, that Germane Beast cares not
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119940:171"/> for gold.</hi> God himſelf (ſayes <hi>Luther) ſhall not put me off with theſe things. Hooper</hi> when one offered him a pardon for life if he would recant, he cryed out, <hi>If you love my ſoul, away with it: For Gods ſake away, away with it:</hi> But to ſuch men the things of Chriſt, truths of Chriſt, waies of Chriſt, Words of Chriſt, Commands of Chriſt do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>And herein alſo are the Spirits of Gods Saints ſatisfied. How was it with that holy man who replyed to his friend, Speak to me while you will, no words can ſatisfie me except you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Chriſt. Write to me what you pleaſe, it will not ſatisfie me, unleſſe in your letters I may read Chriſt. Give me never ſo much I cannot be ſatisfied, except you help me to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Chriſt. Chriſt and the things of Chriſt were onely things that ſatisfied the ſpirit of this precious man. Suitable things are ready to run into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to mix, and hold faſt together. This made <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image to fall aſunder: becauſe it was made up of ſuch unſuitable matter, things of ſuch a differing nature. This makes famous
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119940:172"/> profeſſors to fall, and divers to deſert Chriſt; becauſe the things of Chriſt do not ſuite to their ſpirits. The ſpirits of ſincere Saints are agreeable to gracious objects, the very frame of their hearts is fitted to the waies of truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Among good things, with that which is beſt their ſpirits beſt agree. The more holy and pure any perſon or Ordinance is, the better there with their ſpirits accord. The new nature and ſettled temper of their ſpirits is moſt ſuitable to the Lord himſelf, and may not they be in the Spirit upon the Lords Day?</p>

Hence the heart of a holy man is made as the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in which is no place allowed for the leaſt repreſentation of vanity; the very images of evil thoughts are thrown out, and the whole houſe is ſet apart for the precious things of God; and the more plenty of theſe appearing, the more he labours heart-enlargement. As the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. when he ſaw plenty of Corn upon the ground, <hi>he pulls down his barns, and builds greater,</hi> that he may have more room to receive in ſuch fruits: Thus a Godly man by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance pulls down his heart, he ſees it is too narrow for the vaſt things of God, and thereupon labours to make his heart as capacious as poſſible. And by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119940:173"/> every penitential breaking, builds it better. By earneſt deſires alſo after God he brings his heart into a better and bigger capacity. <hi>O whom, Lord, have I in heaven but thee, and who on earth do I deſire beſides thee?</hi> Pſal. 73. Yea, for Sabbath-enjoyments of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a pious man pants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. He even faints for more full fellowſhips and fruitions of God. As againſt ſin he thinks his heart can never be cloſe enough ſhut: So for God he thinks his heart can never be wide enough open. Of ſin he would fain have leſſe, when he hath leaſt: and when he hath moſt of God, he yet deſires more. And by ſuch wayes the ſoul of a Saint is ſet wider for God, and thus the ſpirits of Chriſtians become more capable to take in more largely the things of the Lord; and may not they then be in the Spirit on the Lords day?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Plyable are the ſpirits of Gods people for the Lord to let out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves freely. Their hearts towards the Lord are waxy and willing in all wayes of well-pleaſing, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The oyl of grace is poured upon the hidden man of the heart, which makes all the ſpiritual members of the new man to be agil and nimble for God. As it is ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſſe above thy fellowes:</hi> So may we ſay to the ſoul of a Saint, God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of grace and goodneſſe above thy fellowes. The heart it is firſt and moſt ſanctified, and therefore may well be moſt free and forward for God. In man no marvel the ſenſitive powers and corporal parts are leſſe plyable. As the oyntment was firſt and moſt poured upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and from thence drops went down to his beard and skirts of his garments. Thus the oyl of grace is primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon the heart of a Chriſtian and from thence it deſcends into all the powers &amp; parts of the man, ſo that this hath cauſe to come in firſt, and come off freeſt for God, as indeed it daily does. When other parts reſt, the heart runs. Yea, the heart of a holy man is ſet upon ſuch wheeles, as make it move quick for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119940:174"/> Chriſt; Judgement cleared, affections fired, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. <hi>I have</hi> (ſayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) ſet my affection to the houſe of my God,</hi> and hence he was ſo lively and liberal, labouring to lift up the honour of God in preparing for him a houſe. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and affections in the ſoul of a Saint are ſuch, as that his heart is prompt &amp; prepared for every precept, purpoſe and providence: <hi>O God, my heart is prepared, my heart is prepared</hi> (ſayes <hi>David.</hi>) One obſerves how he doubles the expreſſion, to imply he was willing to a differing condition.<note place="margin">Paratum cor meum ad proſpera, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum ad adverſa, paratum ad ſublimia, paratum ad humilia, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum ad univerſa quae precepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, &amp;c. <hi>Bern.</hi> Ser. <hi>2.</hi> de qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſ.</note> If God would have him high or low, rich or poor, a ſhepherd again, or a Prince ſtill: His heart was prepared, prepared. Thus is it with a pious man, his heart is prepared to put on after God in any condition, his Spirit is upon ſuch wheels of love to the Lord, that he is oft carried out beyond and before he is aware. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Or ever I was aware my ſoul made me as the Chariots of Amminadib.</hi> The ſpirit of the Spouſe did unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly riſe and run out after Chriſt, as a Chariot upon the wheeles. And are the ſpirits of Gods Saints ſet into ſuch a frame for the Lord, and may not

Such a ſpirit acted in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ. 13.8. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid to</hi> Lot, <hi>let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between me and thee, or between my herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and thy herd-men, for we are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Is not the whole land before thee? take either the right hand or the left,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid [though he were the Elder and Superiour, <hi>Let there be no ſtrife.</hi>] His ſpirit did ſo incline to peace, that he would not have the leaſt breach: I pray thee;] he begged agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo greatly did his ſoul deſire it. <hi>I ſcorn,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Luther</hi> to the Paſtors of <hi>Stratsburge) that any ſhould be more earneſt then I for peace.</hi> Brotherly
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119940:185"/> peace, and bowells of pitty are the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gala.</hi> 5.22 Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, temperance. It is an evill ſpirit, that makes men tumultuous, mutinous, contentious, apt to ſmite both with hand and tongue, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.23. <hi>And Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah ſmote</hi> Micaiah <hi>on the cheek, ſaying, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak to thee?</hi> It was not the Spirit of the Lord, but a lying ſpirit that moved <hi>Zedekiah</hi> againſt <hi>Micaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a ſpirit wrought in them againſt the Prophet <hi>Jer:</hi> 18.18. <hi>Come, let us ſmite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> A falſe ſpirit is ſo all for ſpeaking, that it cares not to hear, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Hereby we know the Spirit of truth, and the ſpirit of error. He that is not of God, heareth not us.</hi> Thus a <hi>Manichee</hi> furiouſly conteſting with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> clamoured and cryed out, Hear me, hear me. To whom the good man modeſtly anſwered. Neither hear me, or I thee, but let us both hear the bleſſed Apoſtle. Some they are all upon ſpeaking, wording of it, with a full and fierce mouth againſt others. As <hi>Samſons</hi> foxes that had fire on their
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119940:185"/> tailes, and ſet all the fields on a flame: So ſome have ſuch a fire on their tonges, that they ſet Cities and Countreys in a blaze.</p>

               <p>In holy prayer he humbly asks counſel of God. When <hi>David</hi> had loſt all by a Troop of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> horſe who had plundred <hi>Ziklag,</hi> his ſpirit ſparkled to be up, and after them. But <hi>David</hi> firſt calls for <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt to bring the

Thus <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> before he would march with <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> he deſires all the Prophets of God, and God by the Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> might be conſulted with. <hi>Ahab</hi> tranſported with a falſe ſpirit preſſes onely, Horſe and away. Let <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſay what he will. To <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> he muſt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. Whereas counſel given a good man takes, and turnes his deſignes. So <hi>David</hi> when he was with his men upon the march againſt the houſe of <hi>Nabal, Abigail</hi> meets him, and he ſtops upon her advice, bleſſing God that he ſhed no blood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. Now an evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit having ſprung a deſign, at leaſt ſeemingly good; yet violently provokes, and impetuouſly preſſes to proſecute men, not conſidering or conſulting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with ſuch as are on the ſame mind. No ſeeking to God, except ſome prayer as a colour. They firſt reſolve their buſineſſe, and then go to prayer, then ask counſel; but if contrary come, they caſt off all. Yea, this ſpirit it drives and will rarely leave, or let them have
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:119940:187"/> time to take advice. Satan that evil ſpirit in the Serpent, having upon <hi>Eves</hi> ſight of the pleaſant fruit begun to move, gave her no time to ſeek God, confer with her husband, or conſider the ſad events, onely eat ſhe muſt. So <hi>Judas,</hi> the Divel ſuggeſting a Booty to betray his Maſter, he immediately goes out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. riſes from Supper even when the beſt diſh was to come, as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceive, he never ſtayes to ſpeak a word, but away about his work.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119940:193"/> ear, but to apply the mind, to mark things mentioned, to conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is preached and preſſed. When our Saviour upon the Sabbath preached the Goſpel in the Synagogue of <hi>Galilee,</hi> the people were ſo moved, that they preſſed with eagerneſſe to leſſon and learn what he delivered, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.1. Thus people may poſſibly under the preaching or the Goſpel, have their thoughts ſo helped, and their hearts ſo held, as to heed what they hear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods Spirit may upon the Sabbath ſo move, as that men may diſcern and ſee much into the matters of God, and according to the Word of God become very knowing. Divine things may not onely be opened to their underſtanding, but their underſtandings open to things Divine, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4 Through the Spirit their minds may ſo be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and their eyes ſo opened, that into the good things of the Goſpel they may have a great inſight. Their heads may be gold, though their feet be clay. Their underſtandings may have light, though their affections no heat. Though the tree of life be not yet planted that may bring forth fruit unto God, yet
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119940:193"/> they may have a tree of knowledge ſo full of leaves, that therewith they may flouriſh in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods Spirit may move upon the Sabbath ſo as men may aſſent to the truth of Gods revealed will, ſo as to believe the reports God hath made in his Word to be all infallibly true. A man may be brought to yield ſuch an allowance, and to give that credit to whatever God ſpeaks in Scripture, that his ſoul may ſecretly ſay, Truth Lord. Though that which moſt tranſcends reaſon, as the myſteries of the Goſpel, yet to each the ſoul inwardly ſayes, Truth Lord. Though that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his own courſe, and diſcovers his own caſe to be naught, yet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence concludes, Truth Lord. That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way is ſinful, ſayes God, and muſt be broken from. Yea, ſayes the man, Lord I believe it. That way is holy, juſt, and good, and muſt be walked in. Lord, I believe it. That is neceſſary to be ſought, and that is worthy to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. Lord, I believe it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119940:194"/> incite, as to ſet men in admiring at the greatneſſe of Gods grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wondring at Gods works and words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Jeſus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and taught in their Synagogues on the Sabbath day; there they admired him, and he was glorified of them all,</hi> After he came to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, where preaching upon ſome part of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before him witneſſed, and wondred at the gracious words that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out at his mouth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.17, 18, 22.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Spiritual good things men may be deſirous of. When our Saviour in a Sermon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. preached about the Bread which comes down from heaven, and giveth life to the World; ſome of his hearers were ſo ſtirred, that they broke out ſaying, <hi>Lord, ever give us this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119940:194"/> Bread.</hi> Thus when men hear of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, their hearts may ſpring witn deſires, and their ſouls ſecretly ſay, <hi>O Lord, ever give us this good.</hi> Yea, with joy may their hearts dance and leap, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. Thus ſome rejoyced in the Miniſtery of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Joh.</hi> 5.35. With gladneſſe of heart did <hi>Herod</hi> hear him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Gods Spirit may on the Sabbath ſo move, as that men may reſolve upon obedience to God and his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Go thou near</hi> (ſay the people to <hi>Moſes) and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou to us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and do it.</hi> Jer. 42.4, 5, 6. <hi>I will pray</hi> (ſayes the Prophet to the people) <hi>unto the Lord your God, and whatever the Lord ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I will declaer to you, and keep no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing back. Then they ſaid to</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>The Lord be a true and faithfull witneſſe between us, if we do not according to all things for which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us. Whether it be good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God.</hi> Thus people under the Goſpel, their
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119940:195"/> hearts may be wrought to a real reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the right way, not onely ſomething perſwaded, but their preſent purpoſes pitched to practiſe and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that which is good. Theſe and ſuch like good movings may the Spirit of Grace have upon the hearts of ſinful men upon the day of the Sabbath, and yet are far from being like Gods Saints in the Spirit upon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Now between theſe there is a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference; Gods Saints upon the Sabbath are ſo in the Spirit, as no other ever are.

               <p>For depth,] Thoſe Spiritual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings that are in carnal hearts, are but ſuperficial and ſhallow, they do not reach down into the inmoſt parts of the heart, in deep humblings, and ſoul-afflictings, ſo as at firſt to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation deep. A man admires the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in Chriſt: but does not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119940:195"/> himſelf for ſin in the duſt, as that dear Saint of God, who when he was affected and wondred at the glory of God he ſaw, he alſo (reflecting upon his own infirmities) <hi>abhorred himſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.2. Gods Saints are firſt moved to deep and bitter ſelf-bemoaning ſorrowes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. and after comes in ſweet ſoul-quickning comforts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Others are like that ſtony ground,</hi> Matth. 13.20. <hi>who when they heard the Word, immediately they received it with much joy, the ſeed ſprung upward, but downward took no deep rooting, as in the good ground,</hi> Luk. 8.13, 14, 15. When the Spirit moves upon true believers, it makes them to bottom well, to dig deep, and lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on a rock, and then raiſe their building in holy reſolutions, and ſweet affections, with ſuitable performances; but others, all the motions they feel, puts them upon ſome fair buildings, without any deep bottomings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.</p>

All their joyes and deſires are in and after God. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and who on earth do I deſire beſides thee?</hi> Pſal. 73.25. Others they deſire God, but there is ſomewhat beſides their ſoul is ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In their affections or reſolutions God he hath not the whole heart or whole ſoul and ſpirit. Neither do thoſe good motions they have, reach out to all the precious things of God. Something of God they would have, but not whole God. O how are they delighted to hear of the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, patience, pity, mercy of God. But the omniſcience, omnipreſence, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, holineſſe of God they are not ſo taken with, or ſtirred at, pleaſed with.</p>

               <p>But care not for that of Chriſt which ſanctifies.</p>
               <p>A Saint of God ſpiritually moved deſires to know nothing but Chriſt and him crucified. And, God forbid (ſayes the Apoſtle) I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Gala.</hi> 5.14. Moſes <hi>can prize the reproaches of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 11.26. Others onely regard ſomewhat of Chriſt, the honours of Chriſt, the happineſſe of Chriſt. the comforts of Chriſt: but to bear the Croſſe of Chriſt, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the Grace of Chriſt, and to ſtoop to the yoak of Chriſt, this is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
               <p>For height] Thoſe ſpirituall movings that are in carnal hearts, cauſe them Heaven-ward to make ſome aſſayes: but up to heaven they do not in ſoule aſcend, as Gods Saints who mount up, and have communion with Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. and have their converſation in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. ſitting down in heavenly places with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. Upon ſome movings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119940:197"/> others hearts and minds like Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers leap up, but fly not far; Or as a vapour that aſcends out of the earth into the lower regions of the air, but never riſes to get up into the higheſt region; but when the heat or force is a little over, as a heavy body, it falls back again, and that which was like to be fire, proves but water. When the minds of carnall men are moſt mounted, and their hearts moſt height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, yet they do not come to that pitch of pious affections, and poſitive reſolutions, as whereunto Gods people are raiſed. They do not ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, nor ſo highly deſire, nor ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem the holy things of God, as do the dear Saints of God in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly converſes with God, when God by his Spirit carries them as upon Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles wings.</p>
               <p>For length,] Thoſe Spiritual movings that are in carnal hearts, are for the moſt part ſudden and ſhort; as ſparks of fire that are ſoon quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.11. Or as morning dewes that are ſoon dried up, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 6.4. Through the workings of the holy Spirit, O in what a hopeful way for
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:119940:197"/> heaven are the hearts of men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſet, but things do not abyde, all being by and by beate down. This made <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerve a ſad difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the work of the Miniſter in his calling, and the work of other men in their earthly trades and ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. Men commonly as they leave their work, ſo they find it: But the Miniſters work (who is a Co-worker with God for peoples ſpirituall good) it is one day ſet forward, and another backward. Upon ſome Sabbath O how mighty are men moved! how ſweetly are their ſoules diſpoſed, how are their affections fixed, and their reſolutions raiſed, as if the new building would paſs on apace! but by that time a Miniſter comes again to his work all is daſhed down, ſo broken, as not a ſtone is left upon a ſtone. The work is new to begin, yea, the caſe perhaps worſe then it was before. As water once warmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ward cold (ſome ſay) is afterward the more hardly heated. Thoſe holy heatings, warmings, workings, movings, meltings, mountings, and meetings of God which good men have through the help of Gods holy Spirit; are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:119940:198"/> and better abyding; ſuch good things are ſtabliſhed and nouriſhed in them, that are vaniſhing and periſhing in others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. <hi>John</hi> 6.67, 60. <hi>Gala.</hi> 4.15, 16.</p>
               <p>The Spirit does ſo act and ſtir in the hearts of holy men, and their ſoules upon the Sabbath may ſo act and ſtir in the Spirit, as is not poſſible for any other perſons. The peculiar priviledge of pious men to be in the Spirit <hi>on the Lords Day.</hi>

               <p>Some upon the Sabbath forſake Gods publike Ordinances, and for that cauſe they are not in the Spirit.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:119940:198"/> 
                  <hi>John.</hi> 20.19. upon the firſt day in the week, when the Apoſtles were gathered together [The Greek word does ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſuch a gathering as in Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, it being a word of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call uſe, and ſo applyed in ſeverall texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31.11.26.13.44.14.27.20.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Then the Lord breathed on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt.

It is in the uſe of Ordinances Chriſt hath promiſed his Spirituall preſence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. As the preſence of Chriſt in body is not enjoyed but in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

So the preſence of Chriſt in Spirit is not to be expected, but in the holy Aſſemblies of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Saints, met to honour God, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to glorifie God in the way of his Ordinances, Word and Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is true, divers of Gods dear Saints can by experience ſpeak that they have
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:119940:199"/> met with much of Chriſt in Spirit, and much of the Spirit of Chriſt in private duties, as Meditation, and Prayer, &amp;c. But then this comfortable experience hath been to Chriſtians,

                     <l>Either while publick Ordinances alſo were attended,</l>
                     <l>Or when Ordinances in publick could not be enjoyed.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſtians while they remain upon the Lords day diligent in publick duties, may in duties private meet with much of Gods Spirit. Chriſtians may even in the week-time, have ſweet incomes of Spirit in their private Cloſets, the better to prepare them for, encourage them to, and carry them through the publick ſervice of the Sabbath, when the Lord with enlarged meaſures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing mercies may more fully flow in upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſouls of ſincere Chriſtians may have in the private exerciſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, large enjoyments of God through the Spirit, being deprived of publick Ordinances, and debarred from the open liberties of the Lords day. Yea, when they are held and hindred from ordinary works of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119940:199"/> God may more immediately and abundantly in the beſt comforts break in upon them. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they were in the wilderneſſe, and could not have comfortable crops from the earth, God gave them Manna imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate from heaven; but when they were come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> if they would have a harveſt, they muſt mind their ſeed-time, and plow and ſowe in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When Gods ſervants are ſettled where the means of Grace may be had, and the work of Gods worſhip may be performed, they muſt not think to have Spiritual comforts, as Manna im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate from heaven. Some upon the Sabbath they forſake the ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and depart from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances of God, and ſo are not in the Spirit on the Lords day.</p>

               <p n="1">1. God in Spirit and the Spirit of God is in Ordinances preſent, when not apparant. He hath ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned wayes of working. This holy Spirit hath his hidden acceſſes unto the ſouls of men. The dewes of divine grace they fall in ſmall and inſenſible drops. The ſeed of ſanctifying grace is ſowen by an inviſible hand. Great works are done by a deep and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate energie of the Spirit of grace, whereof no preſent notice is taken. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> by his ſervant put his ſilver cup into <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſack, when neither he nor any of his Brethren knew it. Thus God by his Spirit puts ſanctifying grace into the ſouls of men, when not themſelves, much leſſe others are able to perceive the ſame. In the converſion of Saint
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119940:200"/> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 97. that they who were with him in his journey, <hi>they heard a voyce, but ſaw no man:</hi> In the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preaching of the Goſpel the whole Congregation hear a voyce, but do not ſee what ſecret works the Spirit of God hath in the hearts of men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their good. And though the Lord is not ever appearingly preſent with publick Ordinances, yet he hath not forſaken them. God does never forſake his precious ſervants, yet he is not alwayes with them ſenſibly preſent. As at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> people who deſired a cure, they waited for the moving of the water, there being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons when the Angel of God ſtirred in the ſame: So there be ſome ſpecial ſeaſons when the Spirit of God ſtirs in Ordinances, and therefore thereon people muſt wait, that would have a cure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods Spiritual preſence it is with publick Ordinances, though upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral they have no ſaving work. Though divers under Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations be blinded, hardened, ruined, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.8, 9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. We find a cloud that caſt darkneſſe upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:119940:201"/> ſo that it blinded them, and brought them to run upon their own ruine; yet with that very cloud God was preſent, thereby giving light to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and leading them in the way to <hi>Canaan, Nehem</hi> 9.12. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.

But the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines <hi>fight, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>was ſmitten with a very great ſlaughter, and the Ark it ſelf was taken, yet the Ark 'twas Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and wi h it was Gods immovable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as may appear by the plagues God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>who carried the Ark captive.</hi> It was a curſe to them, yet Gods own bleſſed appointment for his peoples profit. The preaching of the Goſpel, it is to ſeveral a ſavour of death, yet with the Goſpel preached God is graciouſly preſent, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good of the ſouls of ſome, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Heb</hi> 4.12. <hi>The word of God it is a two edged ſword,</hi> it hath a killing edge, and wounds ſome to death; yet through
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:119940:201"/> God it hath a curing edge, ſome being ſaved by the very Word which wounds them. Chriſt himſelf who is a Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, upon whom many a bleſſed build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is raiſed: yet he is a Rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and a ſtone at which ſome ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fall, and riſe no more, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. Notwithſtanding God is never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Son, but abides with him for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In publick Ordinances God by his holy Spirit is preſent, even unto all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for ſome or other good purpoſe. For the beſt &amp; higheſt purpoſe is God Spiritually preſent to ſome perſons in the uſe of his Ordinances, ſo that they are effectually wrought upon, and brought in to grace and glory. And ſurely where ever the net is caſt out, there are ſome fiſh to be caught; and where the candle is lighted up, there are ſome loſt groats to be found, though but few. And as for other perſons, for other good purpoſes, though of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concernment, is God in Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſo that though they are not by grace renewed, yet they are through grace reſtrained. Hence as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complaines that he could not do the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119940:202"/> good he would: So ſinners they cannot do the evill they would. Might good men have their minds, they would be much better: And might wicked men have their wills, they would be far worſe. Hence men are not onely brought to forbear many things evill, but drawn to do divers good things. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt gladly, reformed much that was evill,<note place="margin">Joſephus <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>et</hi> 12 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and performed many things good, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> reports of this <hi>Herod</hi> many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things he did, <hi>as acts of Juſtice, acts of Fortitude, acts of Liberality:</hi> In the time of a famine how he cauſed all his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gold and Silver to be melted, and therewith corn to be bought for the relief of the poore. People under the preaching of the Goſpell that are not effectually converted, yet are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily convinced, have ſome Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inclinations, Qualifications, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerations, Operations, whereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may have profit, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves periſh. All which are the actings of Gods good Spirit, and the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods ſure preſence in the uſe of his Ordinance. Let not any then ſay that God hath forſaken any of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, but let men rather reflect
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:119940:202"/> and fear leſt themſelves ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God. This was commendable in King <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. O, ſayes he, <hi>The Philiſtines make war againſt me, and God is departed from me, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He does not ſay, God is departed from his Prophets, God is departed from his ordinary waies of anſwer; but, God is departed from me, &amp;c. Perſons that do not find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Word, ſhould miſdoubt their own conditions, for Gods Word does good to them that walk uprightly, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> 2.7. Such as ſay, God is gone from publike ordinances, it argues their hearts are gone if their bodies be with us, &amp; they do but learn the Language of ſuch as are gone from us both in body and Heart. But God is with us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some that have been damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſeducers have given out, that they through the Spirit have had glorious diſcoveries of God. The Spirit of God deſcending upon our Saviour like a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:119940:203"/> Dove, when he had heaven opened, and God ſpeaking, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> Matth. 3.16, 17. in alluſion thereto, and imitation thereof, a grand Impoſtor having taught a white Pigeon to take peaſe out of his ear, reported to the people that it was the holy Ghoſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the mind of God to him in moſt comfortable Myſteries, for the which he was much admired of many. And our Saviour having promiſed the ſending of the Spirit, the Comforter, that ſhould make known all things from the Father,<note place="margin">Alſted. <hi>Chronolo. Haereſium</hi> 38. pag. 382.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. One impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirmed, not onely that he had extraordinary Spiritual comforts from God: but that he was the very Spirit of God, the Comforter; and that God had ſent him to make known moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable meſſages to the Churches of Chriſt; whereupon he had many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers and followers. <hi>Luther cites ſeveral ſects in his time, who though they fled from the Word, as Owles from the light, yet they pretended to high rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and raviſhments through the Spirit, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:119940:203"/> whoſe language it loud of large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries they have from, and comforts they have in God through the Spirit, never ſo as ſince they ſeparated from our publick Aſſemblies: before they were full of fears and doubts, but now they are in the firmeſt ſettlements and fulleſt aſſurance, free from all ſad thoughts, filled with the joyes and comforts of the holy Ghoſt, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with the mind of God, and underſtanding in the deep Myſteries of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall onely ſay, that if it be really ſo, let us ſee more of it,</p>
               <p>Both in their lives and actions,</p>
               <p>And in their deaths and afflictions.</p>
               <p>In the actings of their lives how little of the power of this appears,</p>
               <p>Either towards God above them,</p>
               <p>Or towards men about them?</p>
               <p>If they ſay, they now ſee and know ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>h, taſte and partake ſo much, truſt and confide ſo much in God; let them evidence it by their exact actings, and ſtrict livings, ſo as to out ſtrip others in all goodneſſe, kindneſſe, meekneſſe, mercifulneſſe, &amp;c. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the man who boaſts of his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:119940:204"/> belief, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works,</hi> Jam. 2. So may we ſay to ſuch, Let them ſhew their comforts and confidence in God by their holy working, humble walking, ſin-ſubduing, ſelf-denying, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe that they count their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and praying for thoſe they call their perſecutors, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.46, 47. That ſaying of our Saviour to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> may fitly be applyed; <hi>If ye love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Publicans the ſame? And if ye ſalute your brethren onely, what do you more then others? Do not even Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans ſo, &amp;c?</hi> Nay, inſtead of doing more then others] in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions they expreſſe leſſe of the power of godlineſſe, and practice of holineſſe, keep leſſe to the rules of righteouſneſſe, and in the paths of peaceableneſſe, then other Chriſtians do, and yet they ſpeak of higher rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, greater diſcoveries, ſweeter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, ſtronger confidence then other Chriſtians have. I queſtion whether theſe be any more then ſelf-deceiving conceits, ariſing from Satans-ſubtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their deaths and daies of deep
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:119940:204"/> diſtreſſe, how little likewiſe do they lay forth of that firm confidence and thoſe full comforts they ſpeak of in God? It were eaſy to inſtance from among the Anabaptiſts and ſuch other Sects, how eſpecially the prime leaders who have ſpoken of raptures and raviſhing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations by the Spirit, yet ſome of them have died ragingly and in a frenzie, others ſtupidly, their heart ſinking within them like a ſtone. And have not ſome been ſeen who have carried it boldly out, while the Sun hath been warm under which they have ſet, and while the Sea hath been calme over which they have ſailed; but when the winds have been rough, and their hopes as ſhips have been wrackt, their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pourings have vaniſhed? Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a river that at every Mid-Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſwelleth and runneth over the bancks, but in Mid-Winter is cleane dried up; Thus ſome while they have had proſperous ſucceſſe, their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and comforts have riſen high; but when they have been down in the depths of their diſtreſſe, all have been damped and daſhed to the duſt. As <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots that carried him faſt,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:119940:205"/> and ran ſwift upon the Land: but when they were in the Sea, then they went heavy, and their wheeles fell off.</p>
               <p>The Jewes ſaid of our Saviour, Let us ſee him come down from the Croſſe, &amp; we will believe in him: But of ſuch we may ſay, Let us ſee them go up to the Croſs, let us ſee how they can look death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, &amp; God in the face, keeping up the heights of their comforts &amp; confidence, and then we may the better believe them. In the mean while, let not Chriſtians believe they may have high comforts &amp; heavenly raptures through the Spirit; yet neglect holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Chriſtian Aſſemblies, the Lords Day, and the duties thereof. Though ſome men be in Sabbath-day-duies that are out of the Spirit, yet let none think to be in the Spirit, that lie out of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the day of the Sabbath. As whoever would ſail over Sea to a friend in another Land, muſt have both a ſhip and a wind; ſo whoever would in ſoul aſcend from earth unto God in heaven, muſt have the help
<q>
                     <l>Both of Gods holy Ordinances,</l>

And therefore as a man muſt deſire the wind: So he muſt take care that he be in the Ship, elſe if he goes to Sea, his ſoul will ſink, and not aſcend. Some neglect the Ordinances of God, and the duties of the Sabbath, and therefore are not <hi>in the Spirit upon the Lords Day.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ordinances that ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath uſe, are of a lower rank, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In theſe they reſt, and do not riſe to

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three duties are as <hi>Davids</hi> 3. Worthies, that outwent all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.23. In reading and hearing Gods Word, truths are more tranſient, but in meditation they are more ſtayed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>In the Word are rare things uttered and opened; But in the Sacrament they are alſo ſealed and ſettled. In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God we ſeek the ſupplying our wants and ſerving our preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in prayſes of God, we ſet up Gods worth, exalting his Bounty and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>In the Miniſtery of the Word God comes as it were down into the world to us: In meditation we go as it were out of the world up to God. Of <hi>Iſaac</hi> 'tis ſaid, he went into the field to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate; but of a Chriſtian it may be ſaid, he goes out of the field, viz. out of the world, to meditate, dilate, and delight his thoughts upon God. Of God he cannot take in ſo much by
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:119940:206"/> the hearing of the ear, as he doth by the thoughts of his heart. In the Word we hear diſcovered the Love of God by his voice: In the Sacrament we ſee uncovered the Love of Chriſt in his Croſſe: herein the ſoul by a working faith walks into the wounds of Chriſt, banquets upon his bruiſed body, and bathes it ſelf in his bleſſed blood. By prayer we receive mercy from God: By Praiſes we give glory to God. Now 'tis more excellent to give then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Prayer is the ſole work of Saints militant on earth; praiſes is alſo the work of Saints triumphant in Heaven. As in an Orchard the ripeſt and ſweeteſt fruit, and that which is moſt pleaſant to ſight and taſte, is to be gathered from off the upper boughs of trees; So the ſweeteſt comforts of the Spirit, that moſt refreſh the heart, and raviſh the ſoules of Saints, are to be found in theſe upper duties upon the Day of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Now becauſe Chriſtians do not riſe unto theſe higher performances, but reſt in thoſe lower ſervices, therefore they are not <hi>in the Spirit upon the Lords Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The uſe that ſome upon the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:119940:207"/> Sabbath have of ſacred Ordinances, is onely in a lower way, viz. ſo as that their hearts in holy duties
<q>
                     <l>Are heavy and ſad,</l>
                     <l>Or lazie and dead,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they reſt, and do not riſe to that higher way of uſing Gods holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, viz. ſo as in religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes to have their hearts,

Upon the day of the Sabbath the ſoules of Gods Saints ſhould ſend out ſweet comforts, as the conduits of a City that run with wine upon the day of ſome triumph. Upon this day the minds of all good men ſhould mount up into heaven, and comfortably converſe with God from morning to night, drinking deep of thoſe rivers of pleaſure that are in Gods preſence.

Not ſloathful in buſineſſe, but fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. For want of fervency of Spirit, there is ſo much ſloathfulneſſe in the buſineſſe of Gods bleſſed Day. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency or zeal is to duty as the ſoul to the body, without which all is but a cold carcaſe. Zeal is to the Soule as oyl to the wheele, whence it goes quick and is agil in all the waies of Gods worſhip.

It is ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>he was a burning and a ſhining light.</hi> When Chriſtians are before men ſhining in actions, but are not towards God burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in affections, they keep dayes, and carry on duties in a ſpiritleſſe way; And for lack of ſuch ſparklings and ſpringings of ſoul, they are not in the Spirit on the Lords day.</p>

God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made thoſe heavenly creatures, Sun, Moon, and Stars, yet reſted not till he had created man: ſo man having uſed holy duties, Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, yet therein ſhould not reſt till he can attain God. When the Jewes were gone out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were in their way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> God told them, they ſhould have his Angel to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, but himſelf would not go with them: which when they heard, they all mourned, and none would put on his Ornaments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.2, 3.4. Gods ſervants in Sabbaths ſhould not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfied though they had the Miniſtery of Angels, except God himſelf be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:119940:209"/> When <hi>Rebecca</hi> was in her journey to <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe with his ſervants, ſhe rode on the Camel, but ſhe did not reſt on the Camel, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Iſaac</hi> who was to be her husband; ſhe lighted down and modeſtly met him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63, 64. <hi>Jacob rejoyced to ſee the wagons his ſon Joſeph had ſent;</hi> yet was not the ſeeing of them, nor being in them that ſatisfied <hi>Jacob,</hi> but thereby to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſee and enjoy <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Chriſtians to rejoyce when God gives them Ordinances to uſe, yet is not the higheſt Ordinances they can have upon this holy day, wherein they ſhould reſt contented, except thereby they can come to ſome communion with God. It is reported of Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr, that he would never leave off in holy duties till he found therein ſomewhat of God; as in prayer he would not give over till he had ſome intimation from God of his love; in meditation till he had ſome manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods preſence, quickening and quieting his heart. Gods ſervants even upon Sabbath dayes, when duties are moſt ſolemn and ſettled, ſhould not reſt ſatisfied, except God ſhewes upon them
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:119940:210"/> ſome token for good, and ſeals upon their ſouls ſome impreſſion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which they may carry with them all the week.

As evil things unrepented of carry us from God: ſo good things reſted in keep us from God. It is for Phariſees and Papiſts to reſt in good works done, Chriſtians ſhould riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and reach at a GOD in every good work, at Chriſt a Saviour in every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Sabbath. When <hi>Samuel</hi> was to anoint one of the family of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> to be King over <hi>Iſrael, Jeſſe</hi> made ſeven of his ſons to paſſe before the Prophet, and as they paſſed one after another, the Prophets word was, <hi>This is not he, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this he,</hi> &amp;c. Then ſayes <hi>Samuel, Is there not yet another?</hi> And <hi>Jeſſe</hi> ſaid, <hi>There remains yet the youngeſt, and behold,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:119940:210"/> he keeps the ſheep. And Samuel ſaid, Send and fetch him, for we will not ſit down till he come hither. And Jeſſe ſent, and brought in David. Then ſayes the Prophet, This is he, and he anointed him,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.</p>
               <p>Thus upon a Sabbath, when Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Ordinances, Miniſters, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Prayers, Sermons, Sacraments and all paſſe one after another, the ſouls of Gods Saints ſhould ſecretly ſay, Is there not yet another? <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe:</hi> we cannot ſit down till he comes hither. And when the Lord himſelf appears in an Ordinance, each ſoul ſhould ſay, This, this is he. Some, they ſit down in Ordinances, though no Chriſt comes in, little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Lord himſelf is ſeen, and ſo their hearts riſe not. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> comming into the houſe where <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, <hi>ſhe being with child the babe leaped in her womb, and ſhe was filled with the holy Ghoſt, and ſaid with a loud voice, Whence is this that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me?</hi> Luk 1. Now it was not ſo much the Mother of the Lord, as the Lord in his Mother that made the child in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> leap. 'Tis not the Miniſters of Chriſt, nor the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:119940:211"/> of Chriſt, but Chriſt in his Miniſters, and Chriſt in his Ordinances that makes the hearts of holy men to leap upon the Lords day. Thus they are filled with the holy Ghoſt, and fixed with the Spirit of God. Now becauſe Chriſtians do not riſe to a high minding the preſence of Chriſt, but reſt in a low uſing the Ordinances of Chriſt, they are not in the Spirit on the Lords day.</p>

O what quickenings &amp; kindlings, when the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of burning from above ſhall abide upon Sabbaths, the ſervice and ſervants of God ſetting all on a fire! When <hi>Elijah</hi> &amp; <hi>Eliſha</hi> were

This is the Honour of the Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt labour with our ſelves in all the Lords Dayes-Duties to be lively, and with the Spirit of the Lord to act high for God, and to be heart-warm at work. All the Sacrifices of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath muſt be Burnt-offerings: Every ſervice fir'd with zeal. Indeed, for Chriſtians while they are on the Week-dayes in worldly company to be cool'd, is common; [<hi>Peter</hi> never gat ſuch a cold as at the High Prieſts fire among thoſe ſervants, he warm'd himſelf till he loſt his heat:] but for Chriſtians when they are together on the Sabbath in holy Aſſemblies, to have hearts cold, and affectiont flat, as 'tis a diſhonour to the Lord of the Sabbath; ſo 'tis a

               <p>The more we have herein of Heat and fervour, life and vigour, the better we demonſtrate the Day is Gods. As the true Mother in the Kings cry'd, <hi>The living ſon is mine:</hi> ſo ſayes God, The living Sabbath is mine. As when Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, then he was declared to be the Son of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. So let the Sabbath riſe from the dead to its due life and luſtre, and then 'twill appear to be the Day of God. Yea, the more Vigorous and Spiritual we be in the Day, the more glorious and excellent will the day be. O what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is to the bodies of men, when after death they are rais'd again? Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44. <hi>It is ſowen in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſowen in diſhonour, it is raiſed in honour; it is ſowen
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:119940:232"/> in weakneſſe, it is raiſed in power; it is ſowen a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> Thus will it be with the Lords Day, when it ſhall be raiſed from the dead, as it will be more ſpiritual in its Nature; ſo it will be more tranſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in its Luſtre; greater in power, higher in honour, all redounding to the dignity of it.

                  </list> In time paſt the people of the Jews their practice was to prepare for their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.54. <hi>And that day was the preparation, for the Sabbath drew on.</hi> That day they call'd their <hi>[Sabbatulum]</hi> or their little Sabbath, on which they made ready againſt the great Day of their Sabbath came. Yea, the Jews in honor of their Sabbath, and that they might the more mind it, and be in the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſſe for it, they uſe [as ſome Learned obſerve] to call the whole week a Sabbath;<note place="margin">P. Mart. <hi>in Gen.</hi> 1. Tremel. <hi>in Syriac Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphr. Mat.</hi> 28.1. Theophyl. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1.</note> The firſt day of the Sabbath, and the ſecond day of the Sabbath, and ſo on. And thus much is clear according to the Greek in ſeveral Texts in the New Teſtament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.12. &amp; 24.1. And is it not meet then for Chriſtians, whoſe Sabbath exceeds that of the Jews, to prepare themſelves thereunto? We are eaſed of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Sacrifices, have no Sheep and Oxen to prepare; we have the more
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:119940:241"/> time to make ready hearts and ſoules for ſpiritual ſervice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The practice of ſeverall preſent makes ſuch Sabbath-preparation meet, as may appear, if we ponder
<q>
                     <l>Both the good actings of ſome,</l>
                     <l>And the evil of others.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For good actings in order to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Obſerve,
<q>
                     <l>Both the good that God doth in his People,</l>
                     <l>And the good that others do for the People of God.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God puts into his people for their good, gracious Habits, Principles of holineſſe, diſpoſing them to all parts of his worſhip: yea, the Spirit of holineſs to act up thoſe principles, that ſo his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ready preſſed and prepared alway to every good work, much more for the Sabbath in the ſervice thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others [as Miniſters] they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the Sabbath-good of Gods people. 'Tis fit people ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to hear, as they prepare to preach. Gods faithful Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath do not onely prepare matter to ſpeak, but they prepare their hearts to ſpeak the matter. As Cocks
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119940:242"/> when they are about to Crow, they lift up themſelves, and clap thair wings, they may be well awake: Thus good Miniſters when they are to teach, they rouſe up themſelves, and ſtrive to raiſe up their own hearts, and that Gods Word it may be as a fire in their bones. <hi>Bernard</hi> in a Sermon breaks out thus to the people:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bern.</hi> in feſto omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſanct. Serm. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> To prepare you meat, my heart all this night hath been ſeething within me, and in my meditations I have been enflamed as with fire. Is it not meet that people be prepared when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thus prepare for the people? And as for the evil actings of ſome, they are ſad. There are ſuch who on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath prepare for their worldly work in the week. <hi>Calvin</hi> complaines of ſome Chriſtians in his time: <hi>Let us conſider</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>whether they which call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians do any otherwiſe regard the Sabath then thereon to attend their worldly affairs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin. <hi>in Deut.</hi> 8. <hi>Serm.</hi> 34.</note> 
                  <hi>they reſerve to themſelves this day as if they had no other to deliberate for the whole week to come,</hi> &amp;c. Upon the Lords day men cut out their work, and caſt their buſineſſe, how to have this and that done upon this and that day. Shall men on the Sabbath prepare for
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:119940:242"/> the week, and ſhall not we in the week prepare for the Sabbath? Is Mammon more to be minded then God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The profit that will be to our ſouls by ſuch Sabbath preparance, is precious. By ſuch a ſerious preparation our hearts will be well fitted,
<q>
                     <l>Both with abilities to performe Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-duties,</l>
                     <l>And with capacities to receive Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-mercies.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The duties of the Sabbath will the better and freer come off. We ſhall then with more dexterity, agility, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity tranſact the ſeveral parts of Gods ſervice. A cauſe why we are ſo oft upon the Lords day lame in duty, drive heavy, becauſe we did not aforehand oyl our wheeles, inure our ſelves. When <hi>David had put on Sauls Armour, his helmet, ſword, and coat of Male, he aſſayed therein to go and fight with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, but he is at a ſtand; ſaying, I cannot go in theſe, for I have not proved them,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.39. Thus a Chriſtian when he is to go out in the ſervice of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, he is ſo ſtraitened, ſtiffe and bound up, he knowes not how to go on in ſuch duties, becauſe he hath not proved
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:119940:243"/> them, or prepared for them. We ſhould aforehand put our ſelves into Sabbath-Armour, and ſee how we can go, how we can pray, preach, hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would much help.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The mercies of the Sabbath will the larger and fuller come in. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our preparations, are our after-participations. According to the number and meaſure of ſacks the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> prepared and carried with them out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo were they filled with Corn when they came to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 44.1. According as we prepare our hearts at home in the week-time, ſo our comfortable fillings be when we come before the Lord on his own day. He that would have from his field a large crop in harveſt-time, muſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand take pains in plowing and well preparing the ground. We do not aforehand take preparative pains, which is the reaſon we reap ſo little in Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to conſider wherein this preparation of our ſelves for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath conſiſts. Now this work does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize acts of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Each man amongſt us muſt act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon himſelf,

                     <item>In ſelf-examination,</item>
                     <item>And ſelf-humiliation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt diligently examine our ſelves,
<q>
                     <l>What ſin hath been before the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</l>
                     <l>And what need we have of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Sin before muſt be found out, leſt we come to Sabbath-day-work, under week-day-guilt. If for week day ſinnes God be againſt us when in Sabbath day ſervice we ſeek to be with God, no wonder then if things work croſſe. The Mariners in <hi>Jonah</hi> they rowed hard, but the Sea wrought and was tempeſtuous againſt them, and they could not get the ſhip to ſhoare till <hi>Jonah</hi> was found and flung out. Thus in the ſervice of the Sabbath we may row hard, yet not get ſhip to ſhoare, heart into heaven by reaſon of ſome ſin before committed that hath ſet God againſt us. Yea, we
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:119940:244"/> muſt ſo ſet into our ſelves as to diſcern the neceſſities that we have of Sabbath-helps,
<q>
                     <l>Becauſe of the prevalencies of ſin,</l>
                     <l>And the imbecillities of grace.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt alſo deeply humble our ſelves, and be low in ſelf-abaſements. Thoſe herbs riſe high in the ſummer-time, that in the winter ſhrink low into the ground: Thoſe hearts that in the week-time are laid loweſt, they riſe higheſt upon the Sabbath day. Yea, there muſt be ſuch ſoul-humblings for ſin, as there may be ſin-removings from the ſoul; elſe the day of Gods ſervice comes, but we cannot ſerve God in the day, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.19. Thus before the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath we muſt bethink our ſelves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with our heart, and make diligent ſearch, with penitent ſorrowes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt act onward towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to wit,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Towards God, we muſt prepare for the day,

That we may buy of Chriſt <hi>eye-ſalve, white rayment, and tryed gold,</hi> Rev. 3.18. O when will the Day come that we may have communion with God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt! As that Martyr with a leap ſaid when he was going to the ſtake, <hi>There is but one ſtile more, and I am at my Fathers Houſe.</hi> A good man on Saturday-evening going to bed, leaps, ſaying, 'Tis but one Night more, and I ſhall be in the Houſe of God upon his Holy Day: Meet God himſelf in the uſe of Holy Things.</p>

                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:119940:245"/>2. God muſt be ſeriouſly ſought unto. Prayer in this preparative work hath a Principal Task. Our Prayer ſhould precede the Sabbath,
<q>
                     <l>In Sunder,</l>
                     <l>If not Together.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been the manner of ſome, the day before the Sabbath, to meet and ſpend ſome time in ſeeking God by Prayer; and quickening one another. This fervently perform'd, would lay a great Ground of a <hi>GOOD DAY</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to follow. <hi>Melancthon</hi> who lived with <hi>Luther</hi> in lamentable times, though his heart was ordinarily oppreſſed with fears, yet finding on a time a company of good Chriſtians together praying: <hi>Now</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>there be ſome good dayes coming.</hi> Say dayes be evil, yet how would this raiſe hopes in hearts that there be many good dayes coming, if the Lords Day, this good Day were by a holy prayer duly prepar'd for! Indeed for want of prayer-preparation Gods good Day may be as to us an evil Day. But upon due preparing Prayer we may ſafely ſay of an approaching Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Behold, even as to us there is a Good Day coming! O pray, pray,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:119940:245"/> pray before-hand, pray that Ordinances may be accompanied, Inſtruments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; pray that there may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargings of ſins, enlarging of ſoules: Seek to ſet our hearts well upon the wheeles.

               <p n="2">2. Towards the world; what we are to do in this due preparing for the Lords Day, is
<q>
                     <l>Sequeſtration from the Matters of the World,</l>
                     <l>And Reconciliation with Men, in the World.</l>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt make off from worldly Hinderances. As Mariners that intend a Voyage to Sea, they put the Ship off from the Land; ſo if we mean to ſerve God on the Sabbath, our hearts and minds muſt be put off from the world. <hi>Put off thy ſhoes,</hi> (ſayes God to <hi>Moſes) for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground,</hi> Exod. 3.5. We muſt put off earthly affections, for the Sabbath we
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:119940:246"/> are to obſerve is a Holy Day. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and cares of the world we muſt caſt off, for 'tis not fit with them to come before the Lord in the Day of the Sabbath. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. the Jewes ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the man whom Chriſt had cured, <hi>It is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Sabbath day.</hi> Upon the day of the Sabbath it is not lawfull for to carry about us our worldly minds and matters. Therefore from theſe we muſt get free before. <hi>A bird</hi> (ſayes a learned Writer) <hi>that ſhe may fly,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhe flutters with her wings, and frees her ſelf all ſhe can from what may hinder her flight.</hi> And ſhall not we when we are to come to Gods ſervice on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, labour aforehand to deliver our ſelves from all earthly lets, who are in our ſpirits upon the Lords day to be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much higher (ſayes he) then birds can fly? It was <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> care when the Sabbath came on, to have the Gates of the City ſhut up, that not any might enter in with their burdens. It ought to be our courſe to ſhut up the Gates of our ſouls, when the Sabbath is at hand, that no burdenſome cares may come in. That Chriſt might make us a Sabbath to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:119940:246"/> keep, in body he firſt roſe from the earth: In heart we muſt riſe from the earth before ever we can well keep the Sabbath Chriſt hath made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt make up earthly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences before the Lords day comes. While we are at a ſinful diſtance with men, we ſhall hardly make any good Sabbath approach to God. Some they come to Sabbath-day-ſervice, in week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-malice: So that on the Sabbath thougb their bodies be together, their hearts are aſunder. <hi>When you come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>I hear there be diviſions among you. This is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 11. Though on the Sabbath we meet in one publick place, yet if we have our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate grudges amongſt us, and unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled diſſenſions betwixt us, this is not to keep the Lords Sabbath. <hi>If thou bring thy gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Altar, and remember thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave thy gift, and go firſt, and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> Matth. 5.23. If men unreconciled were unmeet for a legal ſacrifice, how unmeet then are unreconciled Chriſtians for a Goſpel-Sabbath? It ſets us off
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:119940:247"/> from God, and gives way to the Divel to end a day in ſtrife and wrath, but in an angry caſe to end a week is worſe; then to let the Sun go down upon our wrath, gives place to the Divel againſt the next day, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.27. There is no Sabbath-duty, but ſtrife and wrath renders us unfit for; unfit to hear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to pray. <hi>I will</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>that men pray, lifting up pure hands without wrath,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. They that will be ſwiſt to hear, muſt be ſlow to wrath, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19. O then eſpecially when the Lords day approaches, we ſhould put away all bitterneſſe, wrath, and anger, and evil ſpeaking, and kindly cloſe one with another. Did we thus at the end of every week make up breaches, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would not grow ſo great, and Lords dayes would be better ſpent.</p>

It is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Orthodox Authors that our Sabbath day begins in the morning, when Chriſt roſe Shall a Chriſt be quick to get out of his grave? and ſhall a Chriſtian be ſlow to get out of his bed? Shall the Lord make haſte to begin the day? [even ſoon after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſay ſome] And ſhall we make no haſte when the day is begun? When our Saviour ſaw <hi>Zaccheus</hi> in the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more-tree, he ſaid to him, <hi>Make haſte, and come down, fot this day I muſt abide at thy houſe; &amp; O the haſte that he then made to get down, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 19.5, 6. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the morning as he lies in his bed, ſhould think as if the Lord looked down from heaven, ſaying, Make haſte and get up; for this day I muſt abide in thine heart, and this day thou muſt meet me in mine houſe.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be very careful to keep off from ſin and Satan. Satan after the beſt ſpent Sabbaths hath oft the worſt aſſaults. 'Twas the expreſſion of an experienced precious man: I look for the Divel every munday-morning; I am ſure then he will come to rob my ſoul of Sabbath-good, if poſſible. I read of a great Captain, who being very ſad the day after a mighty victory, one enquired the cauſe, who anſwered, Yeſterday my heart was too much lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:119940:257"/> up, I had need lye low to day. Have any of our hearts been raiſed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed, enlivened and enlarged upon the Lords day; we had need look to it on the following day, and keep our ſelves lowly, leſt that mind which hath been one day heavenly, be the next day haughty. Pride is a worme apt to breed within the beſt wood. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, beware.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us be faithful to keep up the good we have got: we are apt to catch cold after the greateſt heats: And after ſome cloſe attendance in Gods ſervice to grow more looſe and remiſſe in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let us look to our ſelves we do not loſe the things we have wrought, we do not break the bounds we have ſet, or ſlack the holy bonds wherewith we have been begirt. To be unlooſened on the Sabbath from week-day bonds is comfortable: but in the week-time to unlooſe the Lords-day bonds is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be fruitful to bring forth more good for God, both in our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular callings. That our week day carriage may be the ſpringing
